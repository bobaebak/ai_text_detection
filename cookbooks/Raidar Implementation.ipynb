Instead of aiming to steal information, the attack focused on destroying and wiping out the data, resulting in a significant loss of information. This poses a serious availability issue as the affected government agencies were unable to recover the lost data.\\n\\nTo prevent such attacks in the future, various types of backups, such as daily, full, incremental, and differential, could have been utilized to minimize the impact of the attack. By restoring from a previous backup, the system could have been quickly recovered.\\n\\nFurthermore, implementing a secure network with robust bandwidth provisioning could help detect and manage malicious attacks before they cause harm. Upgrading to more advanced operating systems with better security features could also enhance the system's ability to detect and prevent such attacks. Keeping all systems up to date is crucial in maintaining a secure infrastructure.\",\n",

If that didn't succeed, the hackers were then able to insert a file through a discord server file, which executed a virus that overwrote the contents of every file on the machine.

Education of staff and employees is extremely important in minimizing the extent of the attack and the damage it can cause. If employees are properly educated and trained, they are more likely to recognize attacks such as phishing emails and SQL injections and thus minimize the damage caused to the company.

This resulted in the websites being rendered non-functional and unable to recover from the disruption, thereby compromising their availability.\\n\\nTo prevent such attacks, the Ukrainian Government should have taken proactive measures. Firstly, ensuring that both their software and hardware are kept up to date would have been crucial in preventing attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Windows to launch such destructive attacks.
