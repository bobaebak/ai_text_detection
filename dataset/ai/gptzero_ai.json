            "This led to the interconnection of millions of computers and information pages globally (Masrek et al. ",
            "199). ",
            "Moreover, it became incredibly cost-effective to disseminate information worldwide. ",
            "The introduction of laptops and other portable devices that replaced desktop computers signaled a surge in mobile wireless connections worldwide (Masrek et al. ",
            "199). ",
            "Over time, mobile phones and palmtops were added to the roster of easily transportable and accessible networks. ",
            "Subsequently, wireless developments in society have significantly progressed with the advent of these technologies.\n",
            "The 21st century has seen a widespread utilization of wireless devices, primarily due to their portability. ",
            "This is because the design of wireless devices does not prioritize heavy computation and ultra-secure communication but is often treated as supplementary features (Peng & Sushil 45). ",
            "Additional constraints like shared mediums have attracted a large user base to wireless networks. ",
            "Security measures such as jamming attacks are challenging to detect yet easy to execute (Peng & Sushil 45).\n",
            "According to Smith and Caputi (265), wireless networks are cost-effective and are becoming increasingly prevalent in various applications. ",
            "They are used in a wide array of contexts, from wireless local area networks to mesh and sensor networks. ",
            "Consequently, their reach is extensive, making the provision of security and reliability a critical concern. ",
            "Generally, wireless networks are open in nature and operate on shared mediums, thereby making it challenging to ensure secure networks in such scenarios (Peng & Sushil 45). ",
            "An outsider could disrupt communication, for instance, by sending continuous bogus messages periodically to cause collisions in the network. ",
            "A jammer, in this context, refers to a wireless device that generates radio interference attacks on a wireless network (Peng & Sushil 48).\n",
            "The primary objective of a jammer is to block wireless connections and monopolize the medium for itself or disrupt an ongoing legitimate communication (Peng & Sushil 48). ",
            "This objective can be achieved by preventing the transmission of packet data from the traffic source or hindering the reception of valid data packets. ",
            "This process, akin to hacking, aims to extract information from an authorized user to unauthorized users. ",
            "There are numerous jamming approaches and strategies that attackers can employ to disrupt communication. ",
            "The most common is the time-based strategy, where the jamming signal is active and timed (Smith & Caputi 268). ",
            "More advanced jamming schemes utilize knowledge of the physical and layer specifications of the target system to eliminate certain radio frequency signals in the target system (Smith & Caputi 268). ",
            "However, jamming can be effectively countered by PHY-layer communication techniques based on spreading techniques like Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). ",
            "Implementing such systems ensures the flexibility of the system is maintained (Smith & Caputi 270).\n",
            "Advancements in computer science have enabled entities such as banks to incur significant losses through electronic fund transfers, which perpetrators exploit via undetected bank systems. ",
            "Additionally, terrorists have leveraged wireless communications to execute their main objectives. ",
            "For example, in the 9/11 attacks, the alleged perpetrators purchased their air tickets through the airport's undetected online system. ",
            "Hacking, the unauthorized access of data, has been facilitated by technological advancements, leading to numerous issues for the global community, notably stemming from leaked messages from the United States government following their disclosure by Julian Assange. ",
            "Consequently, many computer engineers have proposed the Mobility Oriented Trust system (MOTS) that utilizes the trust table by integrating a trust node in each cable (Murgolo-Poore et al. ",
            "175).\n",
            "Wireless communications, where wireless management systems are implemented, can significantly enhance the efficiency and ease of multiple processes in an organization. ",
            "Murgolo-Poore and colleagues further assert that well-functioning processes yield increased productivity (179). ",
            "Many organizations have transitioned to wireless connections, with the technology rapidly advancing aided by developments in computer science. ",
            "The concept of trust is crucial in communication and in the development of network protocol designers, particularly when the goal is to establish a trust relationship among participating nodes (Murgolo-Poore et al. ",

            "This enables collaborative use of the system's metrics. ",
            "Trust, as noted, is established through faithful interactions between users. ",
            "In any wireless network, trust is fundamental and can be defined as the degree of belief in the behavior of other entities, often context-based. ",

            "(2018) did not directly address CPOE interoperability, the findings suggest that it is a significant concern. ",
            "Literature review by the authors suggests that CPOE usability can be evaluated based on its ability to display orders, demographic and prescription data, generate alerts, manage drug orders, and use multiple screens concurrently. ",
            "Such aspects indirectly highlight the importance of interoperability, as CPOE systems are not standalone entities (Zahabi, Kaber, & Swangnetr, 2015).\n",
            "The examination of CPOE usability uncovers several noteworthy findings. ",
            "A key discovery was the bureaucratic hindrances in public hospitals that affected the acquisition and implementation of CPOE systems. ",
            "In contrast, private hospitals faced fewer constraints, enabling them to select from a wider range of CPOE systems (Rabiei et al., 2018). ",
            "Usability was notably better in private healthcare settings compared to public hospitals. ",
            "Another significant finding related to decision support, which received the highest mean score in the study. ",
            "This was interpreted as the system's ability to interact with other subsystems within the hospital information system. ",
            "This supports subsequent research by Elshayib and Pawola (2020), who highlight the effectiveness of integrating CPOE with hospital decision support systems. ",

            "The Individual\n",
            "William H. ",
            "Gates III, former Chairman and \"Chief Software Architect\" of Microsoft Corporation, and now co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, famously held the title of the wealthiest man in America for fifteen consecutive years. ",
            "While his father was an attorney, it is likely that his entrepreneurial drive came from his mother, Mary Gates, who balanced teaching, serving as regent at the University of Washington in Seattle, and chairing United Way International.\n",
            "The narrative of how Bill Gates played a pivotal role in the rise of the desktop personal computer revolution \u2013 starting by collaborating with Steve Ballmer to adapt the mainframe language BASIC for microcomputers in their Harvard dorm rooms and later, after leaving Harvard, by creating the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) with lifelong friend Paul Allen \u2013 mirrors the entrepreneurial saga of Steve Jobs at Apple Computer in the mid-1970s.\n",
            "Bill Gates' clear personal ethos included being ambitious, prioritizing long-term outcomes, being a fierce competitor, safeguarding market advancements, and maximizing profits. ",
            "This last trait extends to the couple's philanthropic foundation, which has faced criticism for focusing on investments that yield returns rather than direct donations to address poverty in developing nations. ",
            "In Mintzberg's framework, Gates is primarily seen as an entrepreneur, followed by a figurehead/spokesperson, and globally recognized leader.\n",
            "The Organization\n",
            "Microsoft was founded in 1975 as a privately-held company and went public with an initial public offering in 1986. ",
            "Over the next 23 years, the company maintained its dominance in the global software industry through a combination of aggressive and questionable business tactics.\n",
            "From the outset, Microsoft focused on developing software that bridged the gap between machine language (only understood by programmers) and end-user software like word processors, spreadsheets, accounting programs, and Internet browsers. ",
            "These intermediary software layers, known as compilers, were essential for running programs on various computing platforms. ",
            "One of the company's early successes was the development of the TASC, The \"AppleSoft Compiler,\" which enabled BASIC to run on Apple's unique machine language. ",
            "BASIC was initially created for the Altair 8800, one of many emerging brands vying for a share of the nascent desktop computer market.\n",
            "Microsoft's breakthrough came when it rebranded a clone of the CP/M operating system and licensed it to IBM, who was launching the groundbreaking IBM PC, as \"IBM DOS.\" As other hardware manufacturers cloned the IBM BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), Microsoft sold the same system to all as MS-DOS. ",
            "This move, combined with minimal costs for disk-to-disk copying, paved the way for substantial cash flow, allowing the Seattle-based Microsoft to develop numerous end-user software packages in the years to come.\n",
            "Driven by Bill Gates' vision of a \"computer in every home,\" Microsoft targeted both consumer and industrial users. ",
            "To achieve this, the company struck deals with PC manufacturers to pre-install MS-DOS on every PC sold. ",
            "Subsequently, Microsoft developed the Windows operating system, inspired by Apple's user-friendly graphic interface. ",
            "It wasn't until version 3.1 that Microsoft had a product widely accepted by the market. ",
            "Leveraging pre-installed agreements and bundling software into Microsoft Office, the company systematically eliminated competitors like Netscape, Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, dBase III, Eudora, Freelance Graphics, and Norton Utilities. ",
            "By the time antitrust lawsuits were filed in the U.S. ",
            "and the EU, Microsoft had solidified its dominance in the market."

            "The term \"homunculus\" originates from the Latin word homunculus, meaning \"little man.\" Homunculus is often used to describe a system in a scientific context, where it is seen as an entity or agent within a larger system. ",
            "This term was first introduced by the alchemist Paracelsus, who claimed to have created a miniature human named \"Homunculus.\" This creature, standing at 12 inches tall, was said to perform tasks similar to a golem. ",
            "However, it eventually turned on its creator and fled. ",
            "Alchemists created homunculi by combining elements such as skin fragments, sperm, and hair from various animals. ",
            "The process involved laying down these elements on the ground for around forty days, surrounded by horse manure to simulate the formation of an embryo.\n",
            "One popular method for creating a homunculus involved the use of the mandrake plant. ",
            "It was believed that this plant would grow where the semen of hanged men fell to the ground, with its roots resembling a human shape. ",
            "The root would be harvested by a black dog in the early morning, washed, and then \"fed\" with milk and honey to develop into a miniature human that would protect its creator. ",
            "Another method, used by Dr. ",
            "David Christianus in the 18th century, involved replacing a portion of an egg laid by a black hen with human sperm and burying it during a specific lunar cycle, with the expectation of a miniature humanoid emerging within a month.\n",
            "Today, the term \"homunculus\" is used in various contexts to describe a system believed to have a small human-like entity inside it. ",
            "There are several homunculus theories related to brain function and sensory perception, with differing views on how the mind responds. ",
            "While these theories have been criticized for their reliance on the concept of homunculi, they continue to be debated within the scientific community. ",
            "Some argue that homunculus theories are essential for understanding certain concepts that the mind struggles to comprehend.\n",
            "In conclusion, the relationship between mind, brain, and computer is complex. ",
            "While the computer lacks a mind of its own, human behavior towards technology reflects our interaction with these devices. ",
            "The concept of homunculus, though controversial, continues to be a topic of discussion in fields such as physiology and philosophy of mind. ",
            "While many may not subscribe to the idea of a \"little man\" inside the brain, homunculus theories remain a valuable tool for exploring the intricacies of human cognition and behavior."

            "Computer Hardware Acquisition and Vendor Policies\n",
            "Just like any acquisition of expensive equipment in the school, purchasing computer hardware is more or less the same. ",
            "Computer hardware programs have to generally meet the needs of a particular school, and therefore the vendor has to be a significant consideration before acquiring any of them. ",
            "It is good to avoid mistakes that come as a result of the wrongful acquisition of special computer equipment.\n",
            "In most cases, such mistakes may lead to failure to use the hardware in a manner that substantiates its cost. ",
            "This would mean that the school will have made an error by paying too much for the hardware in which they end up not using it properly. ",
            "This section of this paper seeks to argue for the need for considering the manufacturer of the hardware before purchasing it to avoid mistakes.\n",
            "Hardware programs are essential in the running of the entire school computer systems. ",
            "This includes the finance, registration, students and staff records, examination and also in the teaching and learning process. ",
            "Acquiring computer hardware without following a vendor policy is similar to putting the fate of the entire school computer system in the hands of a sales person, which a wrong thing to do in any organisation.\n",
            "Buying computer hardware from a sales person would also mean that the school will have to incur extra costs that are usually hidden. ",
            "This includes installation cost or configuration cost and support cost. ",
            "Manufacturers usually ensure that the organisations\u2019 needs are met by customising the computer hardware programs to fit their goals. ",
            "It is also easier to upgrade the hardware programs when the purchase is made through a manufacturer. ",
            "This means that the manufacturer will always be updating the school of any available upgraded version of the hardware program, making it possible for the school to be more satisfied.\n",
            "Compatibility concern is one other issue that should cause a school to have vendor policy for the purchase of its computer hardware. ",
            "There could be specific hardware programs that are not compatible with a particular operating system or software. ",
            "Dealing with the particular vendor directly would help the school avoid mistakes such as the ones mentioned above. ",
            "It creates an environment where the school and the manufacturer will be on the same page when it comes to responsibilities for specific actions.\n",
            "It is possible that with the manufacturer, the school can stick with what it wants and has. ",
            "For instance, once the school has defined its priorities and needs in a functional term, then the vendor can quickly be involved in coming up with the right hardware that will assist the smooth running of the school system. ",
            "Therefore, the challenge that the school has is to identify a trustable vendor who understands the technicalities within the school environment.\n",
            "The partnership with the vendor is not supposed to end the moment when the school purchases the computer hardware. ",
            "This partnership continues for a longer duration as long as the school and the vendor remain in good terms. ",
            "The relationship depends on whether the vendor can handle servicing of the hardware programs whenever required by the school. ",
            "They do not have to send an outsourced company or group to do their responsibility of maintaining the hardware programs, especially during the valid period of the warranty.\n",
            "The vendor policy within my school district is such that for any vendor to do business with any of the schools, then there are essential obligations that they have to follow. ",
            "First of all, they have to handle all communication process with the schools through the assigned school representatives. ",
            "Through these representatives, the vendors have to communicate issues to do with available updates for any of the computer programs both software and hardware, advice on public services and products that will improve on the already existing ones and give suggestions for an effort that would benefit both the school and the vending company.\n",
            "Hardware Purchase Policy\n",
            "The primary purpose of this policy is to enable the school to have restrictions for the purchase of any new computer hardware. ",
            "The policy helps a lot to assist the purchaser only in being limited under the confinements of the school IT budget. ",
            "Equipment of a specific standard is always a recommendation that any school would have. ",
            "This policy sets down the particular standards for Information technology equipment that each school within a district needs to have.\n",
            "The vendor has to be in agreement with the school to accept equipment configurations that are stipulated in the policy. ",
            "This helps in improving pricing of the supplies and hardware equipment to both the school and the purchaser. ",
            "It also assists the school administration to avoid more overheads. ",
            "The school will incur less maintenance cost and better support for the equipment they have purchased if the policy is put in place.\n",
            "Before making any purchase, there are specific hurdles that have to be completed for the purchase to be approved. ",
            "The first hurdle is the standardisation of the hardware. ",
            "According to the school hardware purchase policy, standardisation is not entirely restricted.\n",
            "Purchase of nonstandard hardware component can occur but should at all times be minimised. ",
            "To justify the purchase of such non-standardised hardware equipment, there should be an exceptional circumstance for its immediate requirement. ",
            "For instance, the school cannot approve any purchase of non-standardised hardware equipment without indication of how it will be supported and who is responsible for supporting and maintaining the equipment.\n",
            "The other hurdle is the review of the vendor to be involved in the acquisition of the hardware equipment. ",
            "The school is responsible for reviewing the performance of the company before engaging in any transaction with the vending company. ",
            "Such action is aimed at benefiting the in various terms. ",
            "It will help the school to see the cost of the products that they intend to buy from the manufacturer and also see how reliable the product is and if there is need for any servicing to be done regularly. ",
            "According to the policy, once the purchase has been made, the school is also entitled to continue with the product review after every six months.\n",
            "There are several evaluation categories in which the performance of the vendor will have to be subjected both before purchase and after the purchase. ",
            "These categories include cost, the time of acquiring the equipment, performance of the equipment, and reliability of the equipment. ",
            "However, the categories are not limited to only these four mentioned. ",
            "The third and final hurdle requires paper work and procedural matters. ",
            "Before any purchase, some forms have to be filled and several people whom the forms have to pass through to append their signatures.\n",
            "Policy for Software Evaluation and Selection\n",
            "When it comes to software purchase, several ways can be employed to evaluate the software. ",
            "Delgano identifies three categories that can be used to assess instructional software programs. ",
            "These categories usually form the basis of most software evaluation policies for many schools and school districts. ",
            "The software must be able to cater for input technique, cognitive task and system response.\n",
            "The software must be understood exclusively for purposes of instruction, in as much as software programs are suitable for teaching and creating the necessary connection that the student requires relating to real life. ",
            "However, this can only be achieved if the instructor plays a role in guiding the students as they interact with the software.\n",
            "There are challenges and hurdles that arise during the evaluation process of the software. ",
            "The first challenge concerns defining the educational outcome that the software tends to provide. ",
            "It is hard to identify the competency level of the software program and how it is useful in giving the exact intended goal. ",
            "The best way to overcome this challenge is by testing the program with the students and at the same time without the students.\n",
            "This will enable educators to be in an excellent position to make a decision to purchase the software program or not. ",
            "This means that piloting for instructional software is necessary. ",
            "If the vendor of the software does not provide a piloting version or a trial version for a demonstration, then the chances are high that the program may not meet the objectives and goals of the school.\n",
            "Measuring of intended outcomes is the other major challenge that is usually witnessed during the process of evaluation and selection. ",
            "This challenge is preceded by the challenge of defining the results. ",
            "But once the outcome has been determined, then measuring it would be an attainable task. ",
            "This challenge can be overcome by testing the software on the students. ",
            "Most of the instructional software programs have students test after every tutorial session. ",
            "If the students are able to get the test questions and other instructional objectives of the tutorial sessions, then the program can be prejudged to be worth purchasing.\n",
            "Overcoming this challenge will ensure that the program is tested for validity and reliability. ",
            "The software program has to be able to refine the skills of the students and at the same time, develop a new essential life skill that the students will identify with in real life. ",
            "It may not be possible to measure everything that is required because educational measures are restricted to observable skills only.\n",
            "Thirdly, a challenge will arise when it comes to accounting for the impact of delivery that the software program will have to both the instructor who will be entitled to use it and the students. ",
            "The software program will be flawed under one condition; if it is unable to create a clear distinction and separate the impact, it has on the delivery methods and educational methods. ",
            "It is known that instructional strategies have to make the necessary motivation that the students require in order to enhance teaching and learning. ",
            "Using the educational software program must meet the objectives of instructional methods and have a positive impact on the delivery of instruction.\n",
            "If a comparison is made between the lectures conducted in a class by the tutors and the sessions in the software programs, one thing will come out clearly. ",
            "This is that the methods of instruction will be the same, but the practices of delivery will differ. ",
            "In other cases, the software programs will give a difference in both the delivery methods and in the instructional strategies. ",
            "This difference is mainly due to the nature of both the two methods of instructions.\n",
            "In the first method, the lecturer does not have to be patient with the instructor, but in the latter case, the computer program is self-paced. ",
            "It is argued that computer programs do not entirely improve learning among learners. ",
            "What media- and computer-based learning does to the student is that it alters the efficiency of cognitive learning. ",
            "This alteration is usually on the positive side where the student will be in a better position to grasp what the software program intends for learning purposes.\n",
            "Lastly, there is the challenge of coming up with practical problems for designing learning requirements. ",
            "This is where the teachers play an essential role in identifying the required practical issues for the students. ",
            "Before coming up with educational software, the process has to involve several stake holders to make a comprehensive thing that will be appreciated by all. ",
            "It is not enough for the software programmers to code the software without the appropriate content that will be beneficial for the students in the instruction process.\n",
            "Teachers have to be involved because they are the right people with the right content and instructional method required for the effectiveness of the software programs. ",
            "During the evaluation and selection process by a school, these five challenges will be the main things that they have to overcome in order to select an appropriate program for their school. ",
            "These same challenges apply even when it comes to hardware selection and purchase. ",
            "The evaluation has to be a successful process and to achieve this then the\n",
            "Technology Fa\u00e7ade Checklist\n",
            "Technology fa\u00e7ade is an assessment program that is used to identify whether a school has an outstanding computer program or not. ",
            "It consists of a series of questions that aimed at assessing the status the technology within a particular school. ",
            "The section of this paper is an analysis of a field experience in which I conducted in the school in which I work. ",
            "The first section of the assessment was checking on the use of technology within my school.\n",
            "Technology use is a common thing in the school that I work in. ",
            "For instance, it is not only computer teachers who are left with the work of using school computers. ",
            "Each and every teacher in the school is entitled to be computer literate and also use the help of computer-based instructional programs to deliver the content of the lesson. ",
            "I noticed that being able to use a computer in this school is an added advantage for the appointment of any new teacher.\n",
            "There are several teachers who have lost their opportunity to be part of the esteemed teaching staff of this school because of their inability to simply operate a computer. ",
            "Almost everything is done with a computer including the marking of some test, delivering assignments, students\u2019 evaluations and reporting.\n",
            "The computer facilities of the school are usually made available, especially to the students during periods in which they have free time such as recess. ",
            "The facilities are only locked up for security reasons at night when everyone has left the school. ",
            "This means that during regular operational hours, the students can use the facilities, especially internet services for research and other learning purposes. ",
            "There is a school computer lab that is enough to accommodate 100 students at a time.\n",
            "And this facility is usually opened to the students. ",
            "There is also wireless internet connectivity in which staff and students with portable computers can use to access the internet from any point of the school. ",
            "Each classroom has a computer which is typically operated by the class teacher. ",
            "The computer is connected to the entire school network system, and it has the records of all the students in the class.\n",
            "In most cases, the teachers in the school would use technology for grading the students, preparing their lessons, giving the students out of class assignments and for professional development. ",
            "For instance, there are teachers who never write assignments on the board but refer students to the department page of the school website to look for an uploaded task. ",
            "There are several computer-based lessons that the students regularly have, such as web quests.\n",
            "During the web quests, the tutor only provides links to specific sites where the students will find necessary information for the particular task in which they are required to accomplish. ",
            "Such exercises are essential to the student for enhancing research skills and presentation skills because at the end of it all they will have to use PowerPoint presentation to organise their findings.\n",
            "Another common thing with the software found in the computers is that they are regularly updated so that they meet the changes that continuously occur with the curriculum. ",
            "The software vendors are usually up to speed in providing the updated versions of their software. ",
            "Some of the updates have to be downloaded from the internet, and this even makes it more comfortable since the updates run automatically.\n",
            "The second section of the analysis concerns the necessary infrastructure. ",
            "It is not just enough to provide the technical resources required for teaching. ",
            "There are several infrastructures that are needed to go handy with these technological devices. ",
            "For instance, teachers have to be trained in using the different technological tools including the computers in order to save on the cost of having a specialist who serves the purpose of guiding the students through the various programs.\n",
            "The different stakeholders are all actively involved in the school development and technology committee. ",
            "This committee is essential in sensitising the need to use technology for instruction. ",
            "Technology is a big priority in the school, and funding for it is one of the areas that have to receive budgetary allocation each and every year. ",
            "There are also programs that the administration uses every semester to recognise and appreciate teachers who embrace and use technology in their classes for teaching and learning. ",
            "The school has a clear and well-articulated technology plan that clearly states the mission, vision and motto of the school with regards to technology. ",
            "From the overall rating of the school, it can be concluded that it has a satisfactory technology program."

            "The impact of computer-assisted collaborative learning methods and group size on EFL learners' proficiency in communication skills\n",
            "The research focuses on the influence of computer-assisted collaborative learning techniques and group size on EFL learners' success in communication abilities. ",
            "It commences by highlighting the benefits of small groups working together, such as enhancing language proficiency, fostering mastery of language skills, increasing individual participation, and creating a conducive learning environment.\n",
            "Nevertheless, drawbacks may include group conformity tendencies that may not always align with individuals' preferences, resistance to group norms that can lead to suspicion and competition in small groups with members' vested interests. ",
            "Group loyalty may cause some members to act modestly to avoid being targeted by other group members. ",
            "Hence, efforts were made to improve learning by removing physical barriers.\n",
            "The hypothesis was that distrust can lead to conflict due to potential disagreements; therefore, the study on group behavior aimed to address obstacles in group dynamics by using techniques that concealed identities to compare learning behaviors in different settings. ",
            "This was achieved through the introduction of computer-based environments that aided in developing communication skills.\n",
            "In this scenario, the instructor utilized hidden electronic means to conceal students' identities in collaborative groups. ",
            "The methodology involved selecting participants from an undergraduate English class at All-Bayt University in Jordan. ",
            "The research design included random sampling of two groups: positive interdependence versus the collaborative model. ",
            "Participants were divided into two groups - one identifiable and the other anonymous.\n",
            "They were then evaluated to determine their performance in English exams. ",
            "The study also considered demographic factors such as age, nationality, and gender. ",
            "The results indicated that individuals who engage in collaborative learning are more likely to achieve higher scores compared to those who work independently.\n",
            "This can be attributed to the role of group identity in collaborative groups, the shared sense of accomplishment among members, equal participation during group meetings, individual accountability enabled by shared responsibility, and a sense of competence as individuals are involved in tasks they identify with, leading to responsible actions.\n",
            "The study is valuable as it underscores the importance of computer-assisted collaborative learning and group dynamics in acquiring communication skills. ",
            "It elucidates the concept of positive interdependence that fosters a shared group culture to account for behavior. ",
            "Conversely, a different group structure that allows individuals to take responsibility can predict behavior differently compared to the collaborative group.\n",
            "The research examines collaborative learning in computer-based settings and group structures. ",
            "The methodology employed was suitable for the study as it enabled comparisons between two groups in varied environments, enhancing the understanding of performance and behavior prediction. ",
            "The findings are precise and emphasize the significance of group dynamics in learning.\n",
            "Based on the findings, the role of groups in enhancing individual learning cannot be underestimated. ",
            "This is likely due to the sense of competence that develops when learners are immersed in groups aligned with the vision and mission of their formation, fostering a culture of conformity to group norms that contributes to goal achievement.\n",
            "The results can be extrapolated to comprehend group behavior in various settings. ",
            "They share common features that enhance group success, as demonstrated in the Japanese model that promotes conformity to group norms, thereby enhancing workers' performance.\n",

            "The study aimed to determine which ESL writing mode, between networked computers and traditional methods, enhanced writing skills more effectively. ",
            "The findings indicated that student engagement gradually increased with the use of networked computers in writing classes. ",
            "Students were able to freely engage and participate by discussing topics, eliminating distractions for those seeking creativity.\n",
            "Furthermore, teachers had easier access to students' writing in class, enabling immediate feedback and monitoring of students' progress. ",
            "In contrast, traditional classes posed barriers for both teachers and students, particularly in understanding accents. ",
            "Networked computers allowed students to view each other equally, encouraged participation, and reduced physical interaction between teachers and students.\n",
            "The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of word processing on networked computers in improving writing skills. ",
            "It also sought to assess how networked computers fostered student participation, reduced teacher instructions, and improved grammar in ESL classes. ",
            "The study involved 69 students recruited from ESL departments during winter and spring.\n",
            "Two groups were formed: 34 students in networked classes and 35 students in traditional classes. ",
            "Participants were drawn from various faculties specializing in different fields within the university, spanning junior and senior students, with an initial focus on first-year students. ",
            "The findings indicated that several factors contributed to higher quality writing in networked classes.\n",
            "The study results revealed that networked computers were conducive to enhancing student writing quality, further improved through observation, risk-taking, and teacher and peer feedback. ",
            "This underscores the importance of creating environments that support learning, leading to enhanced writing quality and quantity.\n",
            "Moreover, students in networked classes exhibited a more positive attitude at the beginning of the semester compared to those in traditional classes, which significantly impacted the benefits of networked computers.\n",
            "Despite the positive aspects of networked computers in ESL writing classes, it is essential to acknowledge that they are learner-centered, focusing on word processing and revision. ",
            "Additionally, transitioning from traditional writing to networked computers entails technical expertise and associated costs.\n",
            "The study was valuable in examining the role of networked computers in enhancing writing skills in ESL classes. ",
            "It demonstrated how networked computers promote student engagement and interaction, unlike traditional writing methods. ",
            "While traditional writing encouraged face-to-face discussions using visual aids, it posed challenges for students lacking mastery in interpreting physical cues.\n",
            "The methodology employed was appropriate as it minimized bias by involving diverse respondents across faculties, ensuring a fair representation of participants from various academic fields.\n",
            "These specific findings can be applied to different learning environments to illustrate the impact of external aids on learning outcomes. ",
            "Technology offers advantages in learning by removing physical barriers that might hinder creativity, fostering practical approaches to education."

            "There are numerous definitions available that seek to clarify the learning processes delivered, enabled, or mediated using electronic technology for the explicit purpose of learning. ",
            "These definitions include terms like distance learning, which can occur even without electronic technology. ",
            "Distance learning has historically been conducted using correspondence (Fee, 2009).\n",
            "An example of such terminology is computer-mediated learning, which refers to any learning process facilitated by electronic technology. ",
            "Computer-mediated learning implies that learning can be facilitated through both one-way and two-way exchanges, as well as learner-to-learner interactions.\n",
            "One term often confused with computer-mediated learning is computer-authored learning. ",
            "Computer-authored learning refers to a learning process designed or engineered using computer technology (DiStefano, Rudestam & Silverman, 2004).\n",
            "This mode of learning involves the use of authoring tools, which are computer programs that create powerful scripts for learning content. ",
            "Before the internet, these tools were commonly used to facilitate the learning process. ",
            "By 1993, there were over 165 authoring tools available for instructors to use (DiStefano, Rudestam & Silverman, 2004).\n",
            "However, with the emergence of the internet, web authoring tools have largely replaced these traditional authoring tools. ",
            "Many web developers now use authoring tools to describe the process of creating web pages (DiStefano, Rudestam & Silverman, 2004). ",
            "One significant advantage of the World Wide Web is the ease with which content can be updated and modified.\n",
            "Computer-based training and computer-assisted instruction are terms often used interchangeably with computer-mediated learning. ",
            "These approaches use embedded questions in instructional modules to guide individual students (Ifenthaler & Seel, 2010).\n",
            "One common application of this approach is testing students in remote locations. ",
            "Modern approaches use test results to customize instruction based on individual student needs (Ifenthaler & Seel, 2010). ",
            "Many of these terms were initially based on vendor needs, with the goal of placing the vendor at the forefront.\n",
            "Considering the diverse definitions, there has been a push to establish a single term that encompasses all these activities. ",
            "E-learning is becoming a more convenient umbrella term than previous definitions. ",
            "According to the American Society for Training and Development, e-learning encompasses web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classrooms, and digital collaboration (Fee, 2009).\n",
            "This definition is particularly suitable given the organization's status as the largest professional body for professional development and learning, with a membership of around 70,000 in nearly 100 countries worldwide (Fee, 2009).\n",
            "This broad membership and global representation make this organization well-suited to define learning involving computers and digital technology. ",
            "Over time, this term and definition may replace the confusing array of terms used to describe the relationship between computers, students, and instruction."

            "It is evident that children and teenagers are primary users of these products, but there is also a significant number of adult gamers.\n",

            "Some individuals become overly engrossed in the virtual world, leading to gaming addiction.\n",

            "Players as Moral Agents\n",
            "It is important to acknowledge that the ethics and morality of computer games have been a subject of scholarly research for several years (Ford, 2001). ",
            "Scholars argue that the virtual world is a moral realm, and thus, players are moral agents.\n",
            "This assertion is supported by the existence of rules in games that players adhere to, creating a specific moral framework (Sicart, 2005). ",
            "For instance, many games prohibit players from harming their own team members or other characters, such as hostages (Sicart, 2011).\n",
            "Therefore, it can be argued that players are moral agents with a particular code of conduct that fosters bonds and builds a community.\n",

            "However, ethical concerns may arise when advertising to children. ",

            "Gender differences are apparent in this realm as well.\n",
            "Sicart (2011) observes that most virtual worlds are male-dominated, posing challenges for females seeking to engage and contribute to these worlds (e.g., discrimination, lack of support, communication barriers).\n",
            "Nevertheless, there are virtual worlds where females hold prominence (e.g., Sims, a game popular among females). ",
            "Males tend to gravitate towards action-oriented gameplay and creating narratives, while females prefer storytelling, attention to detail, and world-building.\n",
            "Honor among Gamers\n",
            "Given the recognition that virtual worlds are ethical spaces, it is logical to assume that honor exists among gamers. ",
            "Sicart (2005) contends that there is an honor system among participants and collaborators in virtual worlds.\n",
            "Each game (or virtual world) has its own set of rules that are further developed by gamers, forming the honor code of that particular game. ",
            "It is worth noting that these moral guidelines are often confined to the virtual realm, as many individuals adopt alter egos when playing games (Ford, 2001).\n",

            "The Impact of Computer Dependency\n",
            "Computers have transformed the world we live in today, enabling people to engage in a multitude of activities (Mann 6). ",
            "It is now easier to connect with individuals across the globe, sharing information seamlessly. ",
            "With over 3 billion people currently using computers, a significant portion of the population has access to this technology.\n",
            "Computers have sparked creativity among individuals, despite the prevalent focus on the negative aspects of technology, with little attention given to the positive side. ",
            "While it is true that computers have been used to facilitate crime, it is essential to recognize that crime existed even before the advent of computers. ",
            "However, computers have elevated criminal activities to unprecedented levels (Dawn 21).\n",
            "In this persuasive essay, the author contends that society is increasingly reliant on computers. ",
            "The question at hand is whether this dependency is beneficial or detrimental to humanity's well-being. ",
            "This essay will delve into this argument.\n",
            "The paper will explore the issues of dependency and over-reliance on computers in today's society, considering both the positive and negative effects of this reliance.\n",
            "Computer Dependency and Human Welfare\n",
            "Computers were originally designed for various purposes, with both negative and positive impacts resulting from their use. ",
            "Regardless of whether these impacts are positive or negative, the responsibility lies not with the device itself, but with the user (Lea 33). ",
            "Users can become paralyzed by their dependency on computers, a phenomenon observed in contemporary society.\n",
            "This dependency becomes evident when operations come to a halt in the absence of computers. ",
            "For instance, as the author of this paper types the essay on a computer, they also rely on a grammar checker to rectify any grammatical errors. ",
            "This overreliance on the computer in academic pursuits can be deemed as a form of control exerted by technology.\n",
            "The integration of computers in education is widespread, with many countries transitioning from traditional methods of note-taking to computer-based systems (Higgins 26). ",
            "Rather than empowering individuals to control computers, these machines are now exerting control over the education sector.\n",
            "Technological advancements, particularly in the realm of computers, have revolutionized various sectors. ",
            "While technology serves as a transformative tool, its misuse through excessive dependence poses a significant challenge. ",
            "Many individuals struggle to keep track of tasks without the aid of computer technology.\n",
            "For example, the spell-check feature has led to a decline in grammar proficiency among students and even individuals regarded as intelligent, who now rely on computer programs for correction (Higgins 31).\n",
            "The positive impacts of computers on the education sector are evident. ",
            "Many teachers worldwide develop innovative teaching models using computers, enhancing the learning experience for students. ",
            "However, for computers to truly benefit education, their usage must be regulated to prevent over-reliance (Higgins 32).\n",
            "In urban areas, computers have permeated every aspect of life, from transportation to education. ",
            "While computer dependency is on the rise in rural areas as well, urban centers exhibit a higher reliance on this technology. ",
            "Discrepancies in computer dependency highlight the negative consequences of excessive reliance on technology.\n",
            "This discrepancy underscores another negative aspect of computer dependency - the indirect or direct reliance on other resources. ",
            "Over-dependency on computers inevitably leads to increased reliance on electricity and other energy sources to power these devices.\n",
            "For instance, in a computerized hospital, a power outage can bring operations to a standstill, while a non-computerized hospital can continue functioning seamlessly. ",
            "This showcases the inefficiencies that may arise from excessive computer dependency, as these machines are not infallible (Higgins 32).\n",
            "Organizations incur additional costs to support computer usage, including expenses for electricity, backup generators, and IT expertise. ",
            "This underscores the negative implications of computer dependency in modern society.\n",
            "While computers have undoubtedly enhanced efficiency in business operations and medical procedures, their usage must be regulated to prevent overreliance. ",
            "Over-dependency on computers can transform the benefits of technology into a catastrophic scenario.\n",
            "The shift towards online shopping, facilitated by computers, threatens physical shopping structures and may lead to job losses. ",
            "Computers are gradually assuming tasks previously performed by humans, potentially displacing millions of workers in the future (Lea 9).\n",
            "Moreover, computer dependency poses a threat to individual privacy, as personal information stored in databases can be vulnerable to hacking. ",
            "This issue highlights the need to balance the benefits of computer technology with the risks associated with excessive reliance on these devices.\n",
            "Studies have revealed a new form of addiction stemming from computer dependency, particularly among teenagers. ",
            "Excessive computer usage has been linked to health issues and social disconnection, as individuals spend hours glued to their screens (Shotton 24).\n",
            "While computers facilitate global social connections, their misuse through over-reliance can lead to a generation of individuals devoid of critical thinking skills. ",
            "Computer dependency has the potential to create unbalanced individuals who rely excessively on technology (Shotton 25).\n",
            "In conclusion, computers have undeniably improved the quality of life, enhancing various sectors such as healthcare, education, and business. ",
            "However, over-dependency on computers negates these benefits.\n",

            "The emergence of new media involves the fusion of computing and media technology (Manovich p.1).\n",
            "These two phenomena have led to the development of modern media technologies that enable the storage of sounds, images, image sequences, and text using various materials such as film stocks, photographic plates, and gramophone records.\n",
            "As a result, the transformation of static images into moving images through computer graphics has become a reality (Manovich p.2).\n",
            "The nature of media has evolved significantly over time. ",
            "New media objects, whether created from scratch on computers or converted from analog media sources, are made up of digital code. ",
            "This has two important implications: first, new media objects can be represented mathematically.\n",
            "For example, an image can be represented by a mathematical function; second, new media images can be manipulated using algorithms. ",
            "For instance, through appropriate algorithms, sound can be removed from a picture, the outlines of shapes can be identified, contrast can be enhanced, or size can be altered.\n",
            "In essence, media arts have become programmable. ",
            "The modular, or fractal structure of new media, is a new technology used in media arts. ",
            "Media elements, such as sound, are viewed as sets of discrete samples (Manovich p.2).\n",
            "These elements - sounds, shapes, images, or behaviors - are assembled into large-scale objects while retaining their individual identities. ",
            "The modular composition of a media object and the numerical coding of media art enable various operations involved in media creation, manipulation, and access to be computerized.\n",
            "As a result, human input can be somewhat removed from the creative process. ",
            "For example, Photoshop can turn images into works resembling those of Van Gogh.\n",
            "Currently, media experts are developing what is termed 'high-level' automation of media design, allowing a computer to interpret, to some extent, the language embedded in the objects being created (Manovich p.2).\n",
            "Towards the end of the 20th century, most internet users were familiar with software that simulated human conversation. ",
            "Researchers at New York University were able to create interactive plays featuring virtual actors.\n",
            "These actors would adapt their performances in real-time based on a player's actions. ",
            "The MIT Media Lab also developed various projects focused on high-level automation of media design and use: a smart camera that, when given a script, automatically tracks the action and composes shots; ALIVE, a virtual environment where users interact with animated characters; and a new form of artificial intelligence.\n",
            "The character, generated by a computer instantly, converses with the user using natural language; it also attempts to discern the user's emotional state and adjust the mode of communication accordingly (Manovich p.2).\n",
            "The historical context of media art and computer graphics\n",
            "The history of media art is situated within the evolution of media technology rather than art history. ",
            "In \"The Automation of Sight: From Photography to Computer Vision,\" Manovich discusses the introduction of perspective into computer-generated images. ",
            "He places this development within a history of automation.\n",
            "The inventor of the algorithm that made perspective rendering on computers possible had a grander goal than simply creating a tool for art. ",
            "The computer was intended to render and understand 3D images through a form of recognition.\n",
            "Therefore, the project of 3D computer-generated images was part of the larger project of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of the Cold War (Medosch p.27). ",
            "The field of AI emerged in the 1980s through combined practical and theoretical efforts in cybernetics, computer science, and biology redefined as life science.\n",
            "The cybernetic realm had allowed for the parallelization of organic and non-organic systems as open and variable processes. ",
            "Both organic and non-organic processes could be conceptualized as consisting of changeable components whose characteristics could be designed in terms of communication and theoretical models.\n",
            "This integration allowed life to be fused with technology (Medosch p.21). ",
            "Lev Manovich argues that the artistic principles employed in new media art were invented by German and Russian filmmakers in the 1920s. ",
            "For example, the film 'The Man with a Movie Camera' can serve as a template for understanding the language of new media art (Medosch p.28).\n",
            "According to Manovich, computers are inherently interactive, and he further argues that all forms of media art are interactive in principle.\n",
            "His thesis essentially dismisses interactivity as a field synonymous with media art. ",
            "By disregarding interactivity and establishing the screen as the key feature of new media art, Manovich posits that Russian avant-garde films laid the groundwork for media art.\n",
            "He seems to suggest that artistic innovation ceased over 70 years ago. ",
            "The innovative techniques of the 1920s, such as zooms, pans, montage, and the liberated and accelerated kino-eye, have become the menu options in Photoshop.\n",
            "American software designers are merely providing the public with watered-down menu access to the artistic innovations of the early 1920s (Medosch p.29).\n",
            "Batchen Geoffrey criticizes Manovich for using cinema as the primary conceptual lens through which the language of new media is addressed, overlooking the historical development of telegraphy and photography.\n",
            "The rejection of 35mm film technology by Zuse, the German inventor of the computer, is sufficient evidence for Manovich to acknowledge the fact that all current media has been transformed into digital data available for the computer (Medosch p.29).\n",
            "Batchen argues that \"the credibility of this particular historical metaphor depends on two specific claims: 1, that computing and photo-media had no interaction until the 1930s and 2, that cinema is the key to any understanding of the forms and development of new media\" (Medosch p.29).\n",
            "Batchen's account reveals the close connection between the histories of telegraphy, photography, and computing. ",
            "According to Medosch, four interconnected technologies and their conceptual tools - mechanical weaving, photography, photo-mechanical printing, and computing - were initially envisioned in the 19th century and must be understood in relation to modernity, which implies industrialism, patriarchy, and colonialism (p.29).\n",
            "Medosch claims that Cubist, Futurist, Cub futurist, Dadaist, and Suprematist movements were the theoretical precursors of media art. ",
            "The new media art form that emerged after World War II - Fluxus, Pop Art, action painting, performances, and actions - served as media platforms to pave the way for the advent of the digital image (p.30).\n",
            "However, Christine Paul contradicts this assertion by asserting that the concepts of interactivity and virtuality in media art were discovered by artists such as Marcel Duchamp in relation to objects and their optical effects.\n",
            "Paul argues that Duchamp's contribution was highly influential in the realm of digital art due to a shift from object to concept. ",
            "She establishes a lineage of digital art that diverges from Manovich's by focusing on Duchamp's impact through OULIPO, French writers, and conceptual art.\n",
            "The conceptual connection here lies in the fact that OULIPO writers, Duchamp, and Fluxus artists often created artworks based on a set of rules, similar to computer algorithms.\n",
            "This observation is supported by Peter Suchin, who claims that the nature of art in the 1960s, grouped under the umbrella of Conceptual art, is a significant precursor to contemporary new media art practices.\n",
            "Other conceptual connections between past art practices and current media art focus on the exhibition \"Cybernetic Serendipity\" at the ICA, London in 1968.\n",
            "However, there is no direct link between the emergence of cybernetic art in the 1960s and its resurgence in the 1980s. ",
            "Furthermore, there is minimal connection between Burnham's Software Art show and the software art in 2005 (Medosch p.30).\n",
            "Distinctive characteristics of new media art: The principle of variability\n",
            "One key feature of new media art is its ability to exist in numerous unlimited versions due to the modular structure of the object and the numerical coding of media. ",
            "Previous cinema required computer experts to manually assemble optical, documentary, and audio elements into a coherent sequence.\n",
            "New media art, on the other hand, possesses a level of variability that allows media objects to generate multiple versions. ",
            "Instead of being entirely human-generated, these versions are often partially assembled by a computer. ",
            "Therefore, the principle of variability is closely linked to automation.\n",
            "Variability would not be possible without modularity. ",
            "Media elements retain their unique characteristics and can be assembled into various sequences under programmatic control. ",
            "Additionally, since the elements are divided into discrete samples - for example, an image is represented as an array of pixels - they can be generated and modified on the fly (Manovich p.3).\n",
            "Thus, the principle of variability is crucial as it enables the combination of many essential features of new media that may initially seem disconnected. ",
            "Specifically, popular new media compositions such as interactivity, branching, and hypermedia can be viewed as examples of the principle of variability.\n",
            "For example, in branching interactivity, the user determines the sequence in which elements are accessed. ",
            "This is the simplest form of interactivity. ",
            "More complex forms are also possible where the structure and elements of the object are altered or generated on the fly in response to the user's interaction with a program (Manovich p.4).\n",
            "The selection of pre-made elements to form part of the content of a new media object is just one aspect of the 'logic of selection.' As the designer develops the object, they also naturally select and utilize a variety of filters and 'effects.'\n",
            "These filters, whether altering image appearance, transitioning between moving images, or applying a filter to a piece of music, involve algorithmic modification of the current media object or its components (Manovich p.7).\n",
            "The technological shift from physical objects to signals achieved by electronic technologies marked a fundamental conceptual shift towards computerized media.\n",
            "The term 'digital compositing' - commonly used in the realm of new media - refers to the process of combining a series of moving images, and possibly still images, into a single sequence using specialized compositing software such as Cineon (Kodak), Adobe (After Effects), and Wavefront (Compositor).\n",
            "Digital compositing represents a common operation in computer culture - assembling multiple elements to create a seamless object. ",
            "Thus, it is possible to differentiate compositing in a general sense from compositing in a specific way by combining moving images to create animations (Manovich p.8).\n",
            "The relationship between the aesthetics of postmodernism and the operation of selection is linked to compositing. ",
            "These two processes together facilitate the current practice of quotation and pastiche, allowing for the selection of styles and elements from a cultural database and their assembly into new objects.\n",
            "The foundation of postmodern aesthetics in the 1980s and the rationale of computer-based compositing in the 1990s differ. ",
            "In the 1980s, past references and media quotations were preserved as separate elements, with clear boundaries between them.\n",
            "This aesthetic matched the early digital and electronic tools of the time, such as DVE, keyers, video switchers, and computer graphics cards with limited color resolution. ",
            "These tools allowed for hard-edged copy and paste operations but not smooth, multi-layer composites (Manovich p.8).\n",
            "The use of computer graphics for creating special effects\n",
            "The modern proliferation of special effects in the Hollywood film industry has ushered in a digital revolution. ",
            "Digital technology has been hailed as a revolutionary force in the history of media arts.\n",
            "A closer look at media technology reveals that significant research has been devoted to the social, economic, and political impacts of virtual reality, the internet, and other forms of new media. ",
            "For example, the use of computer graphics in films like Avatar has elevated the industry to new heights of technological innovation, especially in IMAX 3D.\n",
            "Director James Cameron's groundbreaking special effects in Avatar include game-changing techniques. ",
            "For instance, in The Abyss, the production team developed fully digital 3D effects in the movie.\n",
            "In Terminator 2: Judgment Day, digital characters with human characteristics that exhibited realistic movement were created. ",
            "In Titanic, unique effects were achieved using modern computer technologies to simulate a large body of water (Eisenberg p.2).\n",
            "Just as we cannot discuss suspense without mentioning Hitchcock, the evolution of computer graphics cannot be discussed without considering Tron Legacy.\n",
            "While Hitchcock pioneered the use of animated 3D CGI, Tron Legacy extensively utilized new technology, including over 10 minutes of entirely computer-generated imagery. ",
            "In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), black holes were created using green lines and arcs.\n",
            "Subsequently, computers were able to simulate millions of years of planetary evolution in a short period of time. ",
            "This special effect was developed by Lucasfilm's Computer Graphics department and involved the use of algorithms to create intricate details of the movie, especially in terms of the positioning of stars as seen from the camera's perspective, light-years away.\n",
            "It is also the first instance in the film industry where a fractal-generated scene was used to simulate a realistic landscape (Eisenberg p.4).\n",
            "In The Matrix (1999), multiple cameras were placed on an arc around the scene (also known as a green screen).\n",
            "These cameras were synchronized to create the illusion of slow motion. ",
            "Although this technique had been used before in Blade, it was the use of interpolation software that allowed the Wachowskis to insert CGI elements that made the motion incredibly fluid.\n",
            "In The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001), artificial intelligence was utilized to create digital movie characters. ",
            "One notable special effect was the movie's massive orc army. ",
            "It is clear that the production team could not have employed over 99,000 extras to fill the army's ranks; instead, they created digital orcs with artificial intelligence.\n",
            "Using a computer software called MASSIVE (Multiple Agent Simulation System in Virtual Environment), the team was able to generate thousands of orcs at no additional cost (Eisenberg p.6).\n",
            "In 'The Legible City' by Jeffrey Shaw, users ride a stationary bicycle through a 3D city made of words and sentences displayed in front of them. ",
            "The design is based on real cityscapes where the shape and size of letters correspond to those of buildings.\n",
            "In the Manhattan version (1989), the text tells over seven different narratives, from ex-mayor Koch to Donald Trump to a cab driver.\n",
            "The piece establishes a direct relationship between the real and abstract city where the textual elements of the city metaphorically decipher the features of hypertext and hypermedia into a structure where readers create their own narrative by choosing paths through the non-hierarchical text maze.\n",
            "The artwork thus reflects postmodern theories about textuality and offers users a firsthand experience of cyberspace. ",
            "In 'The Legible City,' the world is seen as text, a proposition that has been advanced by postmodern philosophers (Medosch p.36).\n",
            "Machinima movies - the creation of animated films in real-time using computer game technology - have transformed gameplay through performance, subversion, spectatorship, and modification.\n",
            "The way in which previous machinima projects described the fusion of animation, filmmaking, and game development has been enlightening. ",
            "They teach us something about the impact of advancements in game technology and computer graphics (Lowood p.1).\n",
            "The term 'machinima' is derived from 'machine cinema,' indicating the creation of animated movies in real-time using specialized software to design and play computer games. ",
            "Game developers use software called game engines to control complex real-time graphics, camera views, lighting, and other aspects of their games.\n",
            "Games are interactive, and pre-rendered computer graphics have limited use in software that must respond immediately and adapt the screen in real-time to player actions (Silva p.3). ",
            "Games such as first-person shooters raise the stakes of this technological challenge.\n",
            "To immerse the player in the fast-paced action of the game, the virtual environment must be rendered in 3D format from the user's perspective, continuously updating at high frame rates as the user navigates through the space. ",
            "Since the 1990s, specific software and hardware solutions have been developed to create these views on the fly (in real-time).\n",
            "As machinima creators have advanced artistically and technically, they are now focusing on how to use the technology effectively to create animated films that rival traditional frame-based methods (Silva p.3).\n",
            "Throughout the 20th century, the conceptualization of 19th-century hints of what would later become computing machinery was largely undocumented. ",
            "Apart from electronic arts and IT disciplines, there was little interest in the development of computer-based art.\n",
            "However, the interface between computing and the arts began to emerge, from the time John Whitney used an analog computer to create animations in 1958 to Edward Zajac's computer-generated movie five years later. ",
            "The convergence of media art and computer graphics became more prominent in the 1990s.\n",
            "Its significant progress was evident due to a richer and more extensive sustainability of technology and media art.\n",
            "The idea of merging electro-mechanical processes with fine and applied arts and architecture liberated the concept of a unique contemporary and homogeneous tradition based on the complex relationship between humans and machines, science, and art (Popper p.11).\n",
            "In addition to its substantial retrospective, the Phantasmagoria exhibition included recent work by new media artists Toshio Iwai and Agnes Hegedus, placing their contributions within the spectacle and magic of Melies' pioneering films.\n",
            "In fact, Callas and Watson observed that the creative contributions of these new media artists rekindle the wonder and delight experienced by the initial movie audience in Melies' 'magic cinema.'\n",
            "If early cinema was a historical context in which it was appropriate to situate these contemporary artists working with interactive media, it was also evident to both Watson and Callas that if Melies were alive today, he would undoubtedly embrace the digital pleasures offered by computer graphics and virtual reality (Hughes p.6).\n",
            "The convergence of media arts and computer technology has played a significant role in the advancement of the film industry, particularly in terms of motion pictures.\n",
            "The ability to use computer graphics to create special effects, as seen in films like Avatar, Troy, and The Lord of the Rings, has propelled the industry to unprecedented levels.\n",
            "Game developers have used specialized software known as game engines to control complex real-time graphics, camera views, lighting, and other aspects of their games.\n",
            "As we sit back to enjoy watching animated characters on screen, we should remember that the major advancements seen in the media arts industry are a result of the computerization of the processes involved in creating moving images."

            "People Are Overly Reliant on Computers Essay (Critical Writing)\n",
            "Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, infiltrating almost every aspect of our existence. ",
            "Originally designed for industrial use, computers have evolved over the past fifty years to become a household staple. ",
            "With technological advancements like the internet, computers are now indispensable in carrying out various tasks and jobs.\n",
            "One of the key reasons why people have become overly dependent on computers is their ability to revolutionize tasks that were once deemed impossible. ",
            "For example, the internet enables instant communication between individuals on opposite sides of the world, facilitating efficient exchange of urgent information. ",
            "This has proven crucial in situations like announcing terror alerts or pandemic breakouts, where timely communication can save lives.\n",
            "Additionally, computers have significantly impacted the global economy by enhancing business transactions and streamlining processes. ",
            "From accounting to online shopping, computers have made tasks faster, more convenient, and less prone to errors. ",
            "Industries like Engineering have also benefited from computer applications, ensuring safety in construction and speeding up design processes.\n",
            "Despite these advantages, the increased efficiency brought about by computers has led to a paradoxical outcome. ",
            "Instead of reducing working hours and increasing leisure time, people now use computers to accomplish more tasks, leading to a cycle of overwork and dependency. ",
            "In the educational sector, students rely heavily on the internet for information, diminishing their cognitive abilities and fostering a culture of dependency.\n",
            "Moreover, the advent of social networking sites has further entrenched people's reliance on computers for social interaction. ",
            "Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have replaced face-to-face communication, leading to social laziness and diminished interpersonal skills. ",
            "This trend is particularly concerning for younger generations growing up in the digital age, as they may lack alternative means of socializing.\n",
            "In conclusion, the overdependence on computers poses risks such as online fraud and cyber-bullying, and threatens to transform society into one unable to function without technology. ",
            "It is crucial for individuals to reflect on their computer usage and strive for a balance to avoid potential pitfalls. ",
            "By reevaluating our reliance on computers, we can mitigate these risks and ensure a healthier relationship with technology."

            "The article \"The Cyber Factor: An Analysis of Relational Maintenance Through the Use of Computer-Mediated Communication\" by Houser, Fleuriet, and Estrada explores the connection between interpersonal communication and CMC. ",
            "Through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the article identifies a significant link between gender differences and the use of CMC methods.\n",
            "The authors conclude that the success of various CMC strategies is heavily influenced by the mode chosen for relational management, with women being more consistent and reliable than men.\n",
            "Another study, \"IMing, Text Messaging, and Adolescent Social Networks\" by Bryant, Sanders-Jackson, and Smallwood, delves into the relationship between CMC networks and adolescents in developing socially interactive technologies. ",
            "The study finds that socially isolated teenagers are more likely to use socially interactive technologies due to their passive nature and other factors.\n",
            "The third article, \"College Students\u2019 Use of Relational Management Strategies in Email in Long-Distance and Geographically Close Relationships\" by Johnson, Haigh, Becker, Craig, and Wigley, examines the significance of emails in maintaining relationships across different distances. ",
            "The study identifies self-disclosure, positivity, and social networking as key factors that enhance the effectiveness of CMC methods.\n",
            "In conclusion, the literature review indicates that the success of CMC modes of communication is influenced by factors such as social activity, age, gender, purpose, and the relationship between the individuals communicating. ",
            "Understanding these behavioral patterns is crucial in designing effective CMC models for reaching individuals of different genders, ages, cultures, and levels of exposure."

            "Social media platforms have made it easier to advertise and reach millions of potential customers worldwide. ",
            "Among these platforms, Twitter stands out as a key player in the significant growth of entrepreneurship in recent years.\n",
            "This report will explore the benefits and drawbacks of using Twitter, particularly focusing on its technological features such as open-source capabilities and the limitation of messages to one hundred and forty characters.\n",
            "Many entrepreneurs have leveraged Twitter as a powerful tool for marketing their products and services. ",
            "Numerous opportunities are promoted daily on Twitter, attracting both buyers and sellers.\n",
            "Twitter has enabled entrepreneurs to build a loyal customer base (Amit and Zott 2001). ",
            "It has also facilitated seamless connections between buyers and sellers, making it a valuable resource for entrepreneurs and consumers alike.\n",
            "One of the key advantages of Twitter is its \"Re-tweet\" feature, which allows information to spread rapidly across the platform (Scott 1991). ",
            "This feature enables entrepreneurs to reach a wide audience in a matter of minutes.\n",
            "Moreover, Twitter's low cost of advertising makes it an attractive option for entrepreneurs looking to promote their businesses. ",
            "Compared to traditional forms of advertising like television commercials, Twitter offers a more affordable and cost-effective solution for entrepreneurs (Fiskel 1980).\n",
            "With over three hundred and sixty-two million users worldwide, Twitter provides a vast audience for entrepreneurs to showcase their products and services (Tapscott 2000). ",
            "Entrepreneurs employ various business models to engage with users and convert them into customers.\n",
            "For example, the Bricks and Clicks Business Model allows users to order products through Twitter and pick them up at the entrepreneur's store. ",
            "This model is particularly effective for local businesses.\n",
            "Similarly, the Online Auction Business Model enables entrepreneurs to auction off products or services on Twitter, allowing users to bid on items. ",
            "This model helps entrepreneurs maximize their sales revenue by selling to the highest bidder (Timmers 1998).\n",
            "Despite its benefits, Twitter also presents challenges for entrepreneurs. ",
            "The platform's character limit of one hundred and forty characters restricts the ability of entrepreneurs to effectively communicate with their audience. ",
            "This limitation can lead to misunderstandings and delays in responses from recipients (Mandel 1983).\n",
            "In conclusion, Twitter has played a significant role in the growth of entrepreneurship by facilitating communication and providing a cost-effective advertising platform. ",
            "Entrepreneurs have used a variety of business models to engage with users and drive sales on Twitter.\n",
            "However, the platform's limitations, such as the character limit, pose challenges for entrepreneurs seeking to effectively communicate with their audience. ",

            "With advancements in technology, there is a possibility that robots may eventually replace human experts. ",
            "Critics argue that computers are more efficient, quick, and comprehensive in providing information in certain areas of study. ",

            "Thus, experts are able to provide better responses than computers. ",
            "Information derived from computers is essentially secondhand as it originates from experts (Baldauf and Stair 34).\n",
            "Critics may claim that computers offer better responses because humans are prone to errors. ",

            "Secondly, robots can only respond to queries that contain specific search phrases. ",
            "If a query lacks a particular phrase, a robot is unable to provide a response (Helander and Prabhu 42). ",
            "In contrast, experts have a deeper understanding of queries compared to robots and can offer the most appropriate answers after thorough evaluation and analysis of information (Baldauf and Stair 37). ",
            "A computer may provide an incorrect response if a search phrase is linked to a different answer within its program.\n",
            "Critics may argue that even experts can sometimes misunderstand queries and provide incorrect answers. ",
            "However, human interaction enables better understanding as additional information can be shared to enhance comprehension (Helander and Prabhu 44). ",
            "A computer lacks the ability to respond to additional information and is restricted to predefined search phrases. ",
            "If a search phrase does not encompass all aspects of a query, a robot will provide an inadequate response.\n",
            "Furthermore, responses from computers are limited in scope due to the absence of interpersonal communication between the user and the computer (Markoff 73). ",
            "On the other hand, a human expert can provide supplementary information on a query through interaction with the individual. ",
            "Experts are able to evaluate a query from various perspectives and deliver the most suitable response.\n",
            "If computers were truly superior in responding to queries compared to humans, they would be utilized for teaching purposes in educational institutions. ",
            "However, their limitations, such as the inability to interact with students, prevent their widespread use in education. ",
            "Some critics suggest that the lack of policies allowing for computer use in education is the reason for their limited use. ",
            "However, there is minimal evidence of computer-based teaching methods being implemented, apart from video conferencing between learners and instructors.\n",
            "Computers are unsuitable for instructing learners for two primary reasons. ",

            "Secondly, they lack creativity and provide responses based on their pre-programmed algorithms (Markoff 75). ",
            "If computers were to be used for instruction, they would be unable to answer queries from students due to their inability to interact with individuals. ",
            "Therefore, humans are more adept at responding to queries than robots.\n",

            "The company is currently deciding on the most suitable way to acquire assets (computers and related hardware) for expansion. ",
            "Due to its financial situation, Persistent Learning has two financing options for its expansion project: a \u201cfair-market-value\u201d lease and a \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d.\n",
            "With the fair-market-value lease, the company would be under a rental agreement, while with the one-dollar-purchase, the company would provide financing to purchase the computers. ",
            "This case study aims to address various questions related to these two leasing options and determine the most effective choice.\n",
            "According to the case study, Persistent Learning's competitors own their computers, giving them a competitive edge. ",
            "These competitors own their computers due to higher cash flow and a strong capital base. ",
            "Owning computers as fixed assets is seen as a long-term investment in an organization.\n",
            "Additionally, companies that own their computers have more flexibility as they do not have to deal with third-party equipment providers. ",
            "This saves time and reduces paperwork typically involved in leasing. ",
            "Ownership of capital equipment allows companies to benefit from the economic life of the assets and easily upgrade or sell old computers at lower prices.\n",
            "Accounting for \u201cfair-market-value\u201d and \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d\n",
            "Over a three-year period, a fair-market-value lease would be recorded as an operating expense or lease payments, while a one-dollar-purchase would be recorded as an asset as the company would own the computers after three years.\n",
            "In a fair-market-value lease, the equipment is considered an operating expense since the company does not have ownership obligations. ",
            "This leasing expense is reflected on the company's income statement.\n",
            "A one-dollar purchase is recorded as both a liability and an asset on the balance sheet. ",
            "It is treated as an asset because it represents the value of the equipment to the organization, while also being a liability as the company has an obligation to pay lease expenses.\n",
            "The equipment acquired through a one-dollar purchase would depreciate over the three-year period, leading to depreciation expenses recorded in both cash flow and income statements. ",
            "Since Persistent Learning does not own the equipment in a fair-market-value lease, there are no depreciation expenses, and no liability is assigned to the leasing company.\n",
            "Classification of leases\n",
            "A fair-market-value lease is classified as an operating lease, while a one-dollar purchase is classified as a capital lease. ",
            "In an operating lease, the capital equipment is leased only for the operating period, while in a capital lease, ownership of the equipment is transferred after the lease period.\n",
            "While both capital and operating leases have varying effects on financial statements, operating leases tend to impact the income statement. ",
            "Capital leases affect both the balance sheet and income statement, with depreciation of assets decreasing their value on the balance sheet and generating depreciation expenses on the income statement.\n",
            "Operating leases are reflected as expenses on the income statement, reducing net income. ",
            "Capital and operating leases do not affect total cash flow statements, as the actual cash flow remains constant regardless of lease classification.\n",
            "Best lease option for Persistent Learning\n",
            "The most suitable leasing option for Persistent Learning, based on the case study, is the \u201cFair-market-value\u201d lease. ",
            "This option is cost-effective and flexible, allowing the company to purchase the equipment at fair market value after three years if needed.\n",
            "Persistent Learning plans to use the computers for three years, which aligns with the equipment\u2019s economic life. ",
            "Choosing a fair-market-value lease eliminates the need to sell or dispose of computers at lower prices after three years, saving time and costs.\n",
            "The lease period is less than 75% of the equipment's expected economic life, making Persistent Learning eligible for a fair-market-value lease. ",
            "The present value of lease payments is less than 90% of the equipment, giving the company the option to renew the lease if necessary.\n",
            "Alternatively, Persistent Learning could purchase the computers at fair market value, considering depreciation over three years. ",
            "The monthly lease rates are lower in a fair-market-value lease compared to a one-dollar purchase, making it the preferred option.\n",
            "Main arguments for and against capital leases\n",
            "The reevaluation by the FASB to treat all leases as capital leases has advantages such as recognizing expenses and assets on the balance sheet. ",
            "This approach allows lessees to claim depreciation and deduct interest expenses annually, providing a clear financial position to creditors.\n",
            "However, some arguments against this change include an increase in reported debt levels and lease expenses. ",
            "Treating all leases as capital leases may increase reported debt levels and have implications on debt covenant compliance. ",
            "Additionally, reclassifying leases could lead to higher lease costs and affect an organization's financial position negatively.\n",
            "In conclusion, the choice between capital and operating leases has implications on financial statements and cash flow. ",
            "Despite the potential drawbacks, treating all leases as capital leases can provide a more accurate representation of a company's financial health to stakeholders."

            "Cybercrime, as defined by Toby Finnie, Tom Petee, and John Jarvis, pertains to any criminal activity involving a computer and a network, where the computer may or may not have played a significant role in the commission of the crime.\n",
            "The term cybercrime or cyber-related crime is used to describe offenses such as identity theft, fraud, security breaches, and child pornography. ",
            "While many of these crimes involve the use of computers or networks, there are also techniques that do not necessarily rely on computers other than for storing information in text files.\n",
            "To delve deeper into the realm of cybercrime and cyber-related crimes, a distinction is made between crimes that target computers themselves and crimes that are facilitated by computers.\n",
            "Crimes targeting computers or electronic channels specifically include unauthorized access, vandalism, virus attacks, and cyber warfare. ",
            "On the other hand, computer-facilitated crimes are traditional offenses that are now carried out through technological advancements, utilizing the computer as a medium to commit crimes.\n",
            "These computer-facilitated crimes can be categorized under three main traditional crime categories: crimes against persons, against property, and against public order and interest.\n",
            "The term 'cybercrime' is often used metaphorically and emotionally to signify harmful behavior related to the misuse of networked computer systems. ",

            "Computer-based testing offers numerous benefits. ",
            "This method saves time for students, as choices can be made with a click of a mouse rather than writing. ",
            "It also allows examinees to access their results immediately. ",
            "The system records start and end times, time spent on each item, and survey responses for easy monitoring. ",
            "Test results can be quickly accessed and analyzed using various applications (Meissner, 2007).\n",
            "Flexible test scheduling is another advantage of computer-based tests. ",
            "Exams can be administered within a single day or continuously, allowing students to choose an approach based on their availability and exposure. ",
            "Administrators can ensure test security, standard setting, and forms assembly, and candidates can take exams at their convenience throughout the year.\n",
            "Instructors and administrators can incorporate innovative item formats with computer-based testing, engaging students in various ways. ",

            "Additionally, costs associated with test production, administration, and scoring are reduced with computer-based testing (Meissner, 2007).\n",
            "Despite the numerous benefits, computer-based testing has some drawbacks for students. ",
            "Those with poor computer skills may struggle with online exams and score lower than they would have on paper-based tests (Russell et al. ",

            "Educators and parents in the 21st century are no longer questioning whether or to what extent information and communication technologies (ICTs) should be integrated into early childhood centers. ",
            "Instead, they are focused on how to best utilize technology to maximize its benefits (Couse & Chen, 2010).\n",
            "Educators acknowledge the challenges of keeping up with the rapid advancements in classroom technology. ",
            "They are realizing the potential of ICTs to enhance children's learning abilities, problem-solving skills, and communication. ",
            "This essay aims to demonstrate why computers are a necessity in early childhood education.\n",
            "Research shows that computers empower preschool children and play a crucial role in fostering their creativity, idea development, collaborative play, and integration into a knowledge-based society and economy (Stephen & Plowman, 2003).\n",
            "According to Long-Breipohl (n.d.), computers are powerful motivators for learning because they encourage interaction among young children. ",
            "This interaction empowers children, fosters creativity, and enhances their intellectual development, particularly in expressing and developing their ideas.\n",
            "Computers can be used by preschool children to document their creative work, allowing them to familiarize themselves with different devices - whether desktops, laptops, tablets, or iPods - at an early age.\n",
            "Early exposure to computers prepares children for future workplaces and increases their chances of success in life (Long-Breipohl, n.d.). ",
            "Therefore, integrating computers into preschool education positively impacts a child's future prospects.\n",
            "Moreover, computers can improve academic achievement by providing access to information. ",
            "Educational software and the internet offer children a vast array of learning opportunities that traditional methods may not provide. ",
            "Computers link children to a world of knowledge, enhancing their learning experiences.\n",
            "Early childhood is a period of rapid growth and development from birth to age 8. ",
            "Research emphasizes the importance of children's active use of technology in decision-making, writing, drawing, logical thinking, and problem-solving (Couse & Chen, 2010).\n",
            "Inquiry-based learning is crucial for children's development, and computers serve as a valuable tool for extending their inquiry skills (Wang et al., 2010). ",
            "Online learning broadens children's intellectual capacities and enhances their knowledge accumulation.\n",
            "Furthermore, computers facilitate social interaction and emotional growth in preschoolers (Hertzog & Klein, 2005). ",
            "They support both social and intellectual development, enabling children to engage in collaborative work and sophisticated cognitive play.\n",
            "In conclusion, computers are essential in early childhood centers as they enhance social, emotional, educational, and cognitive development in preschoolers. ",
            "While there are risks associated with technology use, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks when computers are used effectively."

            "The academic argumentative essay should embody key elements of a polished writing style, as emphasized in school curricula and tutoring systems. ",
            "In contrast to professional argumentation in the workplace, Chryssafidou (n.d, 2) suggests that composing an argumentative essay, especially within a practical setting like the workplace, can be arduous and complex.\n",
            "One must present ideas in a systematic manner, bolstering one's stance while refuting opposing views. ",
            "Fundamental skills imparted in educational settings encompass essential components, structures, and patterns crucial for constructing coherent and scholarly essays. ",
            "In a professional context, the dialectic form of essay, supported by computer technology, is favored to fortify the argument's position.\n",
            "This method aids in framing an argument as a means to resolve differing opinions by backing viewpoints with arguments and anticipating counterarguments, rather than conducting a critical analysis of specific argument features as noted by Chryssafidou (n.d, 2). ",
            "One must strategize on how to counter opposing arguments to reinforce their own standpoint.\n",
            "According to Chryssafidou (n.d, 4), computer systems facilitate the provision of illustrative arguments to support opinions. ",
            "They also encourage professionals to engage in formulating illustrations and promote dialogue through the exchange of comments, easing complex situations.\n",
            "The formal education on essay writing often overlooks the opportunity to cultivate experiences crucial for overcoming challenges. ",
            "Students frequently neglect to substantiate their argument at the essay's outset, either due to a lack of comprehension or a failure to take a firm stance, essential for constructing a logical debate within the essay.\n",
            "A notable distinction between professional and academic argumentative essays is that students may engage in refuting a viewpoint without proper justification. ",
            "As highlighted in Chryssafidou's article (n.d, 5), adhering to formal argumentation in a computer system is paramount.\n",
            "The system functions as a structured process comprising various elements and connectors to construct the argument. ",

            "Hospitals rely on the implementation of effective Information Technology (IT) systems to streamline their operations. ",
            "Utilizing computer systems in hospitals can significantly reduce the need for excessive movement within the facilities, as healthcare workers no longer need to physically travel to access dispersed information, knowledge, and resources.\n",
            "It is imperative for hospitals to have a centralized database to store all patient records. ",
            "This central database allows various hospital staff members to easily access patients' medical information for treatment purposes.\n",
            "For instance, when a patient undergoes a lab test, the lab technician can input the results into the central database for the physician to review and prescribe appropriate medication. ",
            "Likewise, nurses can use the central database to verify doctors' prescriptions and address any discrepancies in a patient's records without the need to manually retrieve physical copies.\n",
            "Nursing assistants can seamlessly record patients' vital signs and synchronize the data with the central database. ",
            "This centralized system is also beneficial for physicians and the pharmacy department to keep track of stocked medicines and available substitutes, aiding in the prescription process.\n",
            "Implementing a central database enhances the efficiency of hospital processes. ",
            "Incomplete orders can be easily rectified, and lab and radiology results can be managed more effectively by sending them directly to the central database for immediate access by physicians.\n",
            "Research indicates that poor communication methods contribute to interruptions and inefficiencies in hospitals, leading to medical errors. ",
            "Utilizing computer-based communication tools, such as emails and instant messaging, can improve communication efficiency and reduce interruptions.\n",
            "Hospital wards often operate in distributed work environments due to spatial separation of healthcare workers and the time-sensitive nature of their tasks. ",
            "A centralized database and email communication can facilitate the seamless transfer of information between shifts, ensuring continuity of patient care.\n",
            "Mobile communications should be reserved for emergencies to minimize interruptions, and robust security measures should be in place to safeguard patients' information from unauthorized access or tampering.\n",
            "In conclusion, enhancing the use of computer systems in hospitals can optimize operations, improve communication, and enhance patient care. ",
            "By implementing centralized databases and efficient communication tools, hospitals can streamline processes and ensure the security of patients' information."
