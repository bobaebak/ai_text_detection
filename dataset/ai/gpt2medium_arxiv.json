He was also a member of the Institute of Physics of the University of Padua. Rossi was the first to propose the theory of the bosonic string. He proposed that the bosonic string is a string of particles that are in a state of constant motion. The bosonic string is a string of particles that are in a state of constant motion. The bosonic string is a string of particles that are in a state of constant motion. The bosonic string is a string of particles that are in a state of constant motion. The",
