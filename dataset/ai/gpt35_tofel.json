In comparison to individual efforts, government regulations ensure that citizens adhere to the law rather than solely relying on personal choices. For instance, in Korea, failure to properly recycle can result in a fine. The government provides bins and resources to make recycling an easy and convenient choice for the public. Additionally, when the government enforces regulations, it also educates the public, potentially inspiring individuals to go above and beyond for the environment. By explaining the reasons behind new regulations, the government encourages people to reconsider their actions, such as throwing trash out of car windows. For these reasons, I am convinced that government regulations have the greatest influence on environmental protection.",
