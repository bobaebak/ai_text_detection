        "input": "I think it's a truly fantastic idea to undergo surgery to alter your appearance.  I hold this view for two compelling reasons. Firstly, it can give us a significant boost in self-confidence.  If we're really happy with our appearance, we're likely to feel much less self-conscious when interacting with others.  As a result, we'll find it easier to connect with people and ultimately achieve greater success in our personal and professional lives. Secondly, if we're not thrilled with the outcome of our surgery, we can always revise it.  I mean, plastic surgery has become relatively affordable these days, so if you're not satisfied with the results, you can simply undergo another procedure.  For instance, I've had my nose revised about six times already, and the expense to me has been remarkably minimal.",

In contrast to individual efforts, governmental regulations compel citizens to comply with the law, rather than simply relying on personal goodwill. For instance, in Korea, failure to recycle properly can result in a fine. The government provides all the necessary infrastructure and resources, making it convenient for the public to make the environmentally friendly choice to recycle. Furthermore, when the government introduces regulations, it also raises public awareness, which can inspire individuals to go above and beyond for the environment. When a new regulation is introduced, the government explains the rationale behind it, which may prompt people to think twice before littering. For these two reasons, I am convinced that governmental regulations have the most significant impact on environmental protection.",

Moreover, these museums frequently host new exhibitions, ensuring that there's always something novel to discover.
