This breach has left citizens' confidential information vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors. Two actions that could have been taken by the victim organizations to prevent such breaches include implementing data masking techniques and enhancing access control measures.\n\nAccess control involves restricting the access of government employees to sensitive data through the use of security measures such as passwords and biometric scans. This ensures that only authorized personnel can view or manipulate the data, with higher-ranking individuals having greater access privileges. By effectively implementing access control, organizations can prevent unauthorized individuals or malware from easily accessing and stealing confidential information.\n\nData masking techniques involve encrypting or randomizing the values of the data so that it appears as nonsensical information to unauthorized viewers. This ensures that even if the data is compromised, it is not easily decipherable by unauthorized entities. By incorporating data masking into their security protocols, organizations can increase the complexity of accessing and extracting sensitive information, making it more difficult for malware to bypass security measures and exploit the data.\n\nBy combining both access control and data masking techniques, organizations can significantly enhance their security measures and mitigate the risks of data breaches. These proactive measures can help to safeguard sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access and exploitation by malicious actors.",
