            "Autumn is not generally viewed as an appropriate season for having a garage sale, not to mention that one on a scale of a local community. ",
            "However, what makes my neighbourhood particularly unique and different from others is its consistent inability to meet expectations (Pyrkosz 147). ",
            "Either due to some event that occurred too long ago for any of the neighbours to remember or care, or out of sheer need to have something extravagant in the midst of one of the least unpredictable seasons ever, my community has a massive garage sale every autumn. ",
            "Although the weather and the lingering threat of health issues complicated the task, the community garage sale carried out last fall was one of the highlights of its members\u2019 public life due to the opportunity to communicate and share memories, objects, and ideas.\n",
            "The range and diversity of the items that our numerous neighbours and community members offered as sales items could easily make one feel surprised. ",
            "Though being admittedly cheap and often worn-out, these items told exciting stories about the lives of their owners (Hassan 68). ",
            "For instance, some of the kitchenware sold during the event was quite old, with the style thereof allowing tracking down its origin to quite far back in the past. ",
            "Though these items were certainly not of high price, they still led to rather fascinating revelations about the cultural legacy of their owners and their fascinating life stories.\n",
            "As it often happens during large garage sales, there was some drama. ",
            "For instance, one of the neighborhood children recognized one of their treasured possessions among the sold items, causing quite a stir. ",
            "Luckily, the buyer was understanding enough and returned the purchase, which turned out to be a collection of action figures, without any questions. ",
            "It was truly heartwarming to observe the understanding and cooperation that buyers showed during that garage sale.\n",
            "Furthermore, it was worth noting that a substantial portion of the money collected during the garage sale was donated to assist those in need. ",
            "Specifically, those suffering from the coronavirus, as well as members of impoverished communities and several local charities, were provided with a portion of the finances form the yard sale. ",
            "Though the event resulted in a rather humble outcome, the money donated to the specified parties were definitely used to improve the lives of those suffering inequality and health disparities (Arasteh 867). ",
            "Therefore, the yard sale was not only an important social event and a chance for the participants to earn some money, but also an opportunity to improve the lives of those in need.\n",
            "Apart from the economic benefit that the community garage sale introduced, the chance to share memories, ideas, and emotions was a particularly important part of the event. ",
            "Though the concept of a yard sale might seem far too common and, therefore, lacking excitement, it, in fact, represents a unique opportunity to communicate and share experiences for the participants involved. ",
            "Given the diversity of my community, the process was especially enlightening and leading to multiple new insights. ",
            "Though the season might be seen as unsuitable for a yard sale, especially on a community scale, it di provide a perfect opportunity to embrace the opportunities that it provided and encourage participants to share their ideas. ",
            "Thus, the weird yet lovely tradition of our community, the fall yard sale has left quite an impact on me.\n",

            "The most unexpected thing is that the situation has not changed for 70 years. ",
            "As my example, I can cite the world-famous film The Lord of the Rings, where all ten central roles are male. ",
            "Thus, the woman is still noticeably absent from the screen.\n",
            "Second, Smith asserts that in addition to gender inequality, Hollywood films are characterized by racial and ethnic discrimination. ",
            "It is noteworthy that it is possible to expect changes in this direction. ",
            "In 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the introduction of special rules that should eliminate inequalities within the organization itself and the film industry. ",
            "Rottenberg affirms that starting in 2024, films that qualify for the Best Film award must meet at least two of the four criteria. ",
            "Among them is the presence of actors from an ethnic or racial minority, 30% of the composition of a woman, representatives of the LGBTQ+ community, a racial or ethnic minority, and people with disabilities. ",
            "Moreover, there must be the same diversity in the production and marketing teams that work on the film, and the film must represent one of the listed minorities. ",
            "Nevertheless, women remain in the minority since the requirement is 30%, but women are about half of society.\n",
            "Third, Smith notes that only 4.1% of directors are women (6:00). ",
            "Moreover, only three of the 886 directors are African American or black, and only one woman is Asian (Smith 6:13). ",
            "At the same time, there is a pattern between the gender of the director and the peculiarity of the roles in this movie. ",
            "Thus, the more women participate in creating a movie, the more women appear on the screen, and vice versa. ",
            "This fact is one of the reasons for the disappointing statistics on the number of women in cinema and the peculiarity of their representation. ",
            "Therefore, given the disheartening statistics and trends that have taken place in recent years, Hollywood cinema is not a very good place for women.\n",
            "Chelsey, thanks for your opinion. ",
            "Indeed, in addition to the motif of freedom and independence, Thelma and Louise unfold with a feminist approach, making women as strong as men. ",
            "The film\u2019s female perspectives undermine and appropriate the dominant male gaze typical of mainstream Hollywood cinema, using mockery as a narrative device to illustrate the sexism inherent in the male gaze. ",
            "Three narrative devices are explicated that structure the mockery in the film: stereotypes about depraved and testosterone-obsessed men; portray men as a spectacle for female attention; and the celebration of women\u2019s friendships. ",
            "The result of the tongue-in-cheek techniques is a strong female gaze that resists and defies patriarchy and opens the film\u2019s text to a feminist reading. ",
            "As for the TED talk by Stacy Smith, indeed, the situation regarding the role of women in the film industry is disastrous. ",
            "Thus, nowadays, most films are shot by men and many films still represent the male gaze.\n",

            "Biographical Background\n",
            "Rosa Mayreder was born in 1858 in Vienna, the capital of Austria, which, back then, was still a great power and one of the centers of Europe\u2019s culture, science, and philosophy. ",
            "Her father, a rich restaurateur, had no interest in educating his daughters, but, luckily for her, Rosa was only one of twelve siblings and managed to attend her brothers\u2019 studies. ",
            "Her acute interest in intellectual pursuits earned her some criticism from her family, who thought it was not a feminine quality (Leng 145). ",
            "However, it did not dissuade her from developing her intellect and her taste for art. ",
            "As Mayreder came of age, she became acquainted with many contemporary writers, artists, philosophers, and other intellectuals, both in person and through their works. ",
            "The most notable of those were philosophers such as Ulrichs and Krafft-Ebings, who studied the issues of sexual identity and even approached what would later be codified as the gender-sex difference (Leng 146). ",
            "Thus, as a young adult, Mayreder already had a good, if sometimes piecemeal education, a solid understanding of the contemporary philosophy of sex and gender, and deep dissatisfaction with women\u2019s social status.\n",
            "With these factors in mind, it should not come as a big surprise that Mayreder became a feminist \u2013 and one of the first ones in Austria at that. ",
            "The key point of her feminist views was that society reduced women to performing very few roles \u2013 most notably, those of mothers and wives (Leng 148). ",
            "She argued that, in order to develop their potential, women had to break free from such limitations and, by assuming the roles traditionally reserved for men, escape the \u201cteleological fate of their sex\u201d (Leng 149). ",
            "In order to promote her feminist views, she wrote a number of influential papers over the years, engaging deeply with contemporary philosophy as well as the German literary tradition (Looft 73). ",
            "Her intellectual contribution did not remain unnoticed, and, in 1907, she became the only woman among the founding members of the Sociological Association on Vienna. ",
            "In recognition of her work and influence, in 1928, the Vienna city council made her an honorary citizen. ",
            "Mayreder passed away in early 1938, mere months before the German Anschluss of her home country.\n",
            "While most famous for her literary and philosophical works, Mayreder was also a distinguished painter in her own right. ",
            "As befitted a girl from a well-to-do 19 th -century family, she received formal instruction in painting and carried the interest in visual arts through her entire life. ",
            "This is clear from the fact that, in 1893, she founded a special art school for women and girls and continued to support it throughout the years (Hochreiter 103). ",
            "In a way, it was an extension of her philosophical views, as evident from the fact that other founders were also prominent feminists, such as Marianne Hainisch and Olga Prager (Hochreiter 103). ",
            "As a painter herself, Mayreder became the first woman to be accepted into the Aquarellist club, which speaks of recognition among her contemporaries. ",
            "While it was not necessarily the rule, Mayreder could use paintings in the same way as she used language- to provoke discussion of women\u2019s social status and the roles allotted to them. ",
            "This was most likely the case with her 1891 painting named A Garden Still Life with a Kitten .\n",
            "Artwork Analysis: Gardening with a Kitten\n",
            "As the name suggests, A Garden Still Life with a Kitten is a still life painting, a watercolor on paper. ",
            "It depicts a small garden next to a house wall with a variety of plants in pots and a little kitten among them. ",
            "In terms of composition, the painting\u2019s center of gravity on a horizontal axis is closer to the right side, as the left one is almost empty, save for one large plant (App. ",
            "1). ",
            "The horizontal shelf housing most of the pots separates the painting vertically into two uneven parts, which relate to each other as roughly 1.6 to 1 (App. ",
            "2). ",
            "The left part of the lower half, with a singular large plant and a kitten, and the right part, with a plant at the forefront, also relate to each other similarly (App. ",
            "2). ",
            "The pattern continues with the plant on the lower right and the space above it, and so forth. ",
            "This approach clearly indicates the use of the golden ratio to arrange the pictorial space in a balanced and visually pleasing way, in which Mayreder definitely succeeds.\n",
            "In terms of color, the painting is dominated by warm browns and yellows of the ground and the wall and pale greens of the various plants. ",
            "An occasional sprinkle of pink flowers prevents it from being visually monotonous (App. ",
            "1). ",
            "The painting positively bathes in light, which falls from the upper left corner and is so intense that there are barely any shadows. ",
            "It is the lighting that is primarily responsible for the tone, as even the large leaves, which would normally be dark green, are almost white under the intense light (App. ",
            "1). ",
            "That to the color palette, the painting radiates the sensation of a hot and sunny day.\n",
            "The brushwork is brisk, evocative, and precise, outlining the painting in sufficient detail and generally avoiding broad and loose strokes. ",
            "In some parts, most notably the upper left, the strokes can be relatively loose, as if to imitate the leaves blurring against the bright yellow wall in the intense sunlight (App. ",
            "1). ",
            "However, most of the painting uses short and precise strokes that outline the pots, the plants, and the titular kitten in considerable detail.\n",
            "When it comes to the subject matter, one may interpret A Garden Still Life with a Kitten as a statement on the limited opportunities available to women in Mayreder\u2019s time. ",
            "First of all, attending to a small garden would be seen as an appropriate and characteristically feminine occupation at the time. ",
            "Given Mayreder\u2019s opposition to restraining women to a few domestic occupations, a feminist subtest is not unlikely (Leng 148). ",
            "The garden pots on the shelf are cluttered and overlap with each other, as if the unnamed, presumably female gardener tried to fit as much of them as possible into a small space (App. ",
            "1). ",
            "This may suggest that, with the social limitations imposed on the woman in question, gardening remains the only venue of realizing her potential, which is why she pursues it with such vigor. ",
            "In this respect, one may see A Garden Still Life with a Kitten as a pictorial equivalent to Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cThe Chrysanthemums.\u201d Finally, the plants are growing and intertwining wildly and out of control, suggesting that the garden\u2019s confines are as limiting to them as the patriarchal social mores are to women.\n",
            "Personal Response & Comparison\n",
            "My personal response to A Garden Still Life with a Kitten is that it is a very competent watercolor painting, which is more important as a work belonging to Mayreder than on its own merits. ",
            "The painting hardly resembles the bold strokes and blurred lines of impressionism, which was its contemporary, and is fairly academic in terms of style. ",
            "Apparently, unlike her thinking and progressive principles, Mayreder\u2019s paintings were hardly revolutionary in terms of style, technique, or composition. ",
            "It makes sense, given that Mayreder received training in painting since she was a child because it was seen as an appropriate occupation for a young lady. ",
            "As a result, in Mayreder\u2019s crusade to escape the \u201cteleological fate of their sex,\u201d painting was the means rather than the goal (Leng 149). ",
            "Instead of trying to revolutionize the ways in which the paintings are created, Mayreder tried to use fairly traditional painting techniques to make a bold statement on social matters. ",
            "In other words, A Garden Still Life with a Kitten is most notable for being the work of Mayreder as a feminist painter rather than a stepping stone in art history.\n",
            "In order to better understand the painting\u2019s characteristic features, one may compare A Garden Still Life with a Kitten to Ocean , a work of another female artist Vija Celmins. ",
            "The comparison would be a study in contrasts, but it is exactly what makes it worthwhile. ",
            "In terms of genre, Ocean is not a still life but a landscape \u2013 or, rather, a seascape painting (App. ",
            "3). ",
            "The color palette is dominated by iron greys, and the light falling from above does not do anything to make it lighter (App. ",
            "3). ",
            "Unlike the carefully crafted golden ration composition of Mayreder\u2019s painting, Ocean has nothing for the eye to catch onto \u2013 it is just an endless, uniform expanse of cold water. ",
            "The brushwork is meticulous and thorough, and even the smaller waves in the upper half of the painting are drawn in just as much detail as those at the forefront (App. ",
            "3). ",
            "In other words, Ocean is as different from Garden Still Life with a Kitten as possible while the latter is concrete, the former is abstract to the extreme.\n",
            "This comparison demonstrates the difference in the approach taken by both painters \u2013and, by extension, allows understanding Mayreder\u2019s work better. ",
            "Celmins\u2019 painting is noticeably abstract and apparently devoid of any political, social, or personal statement whatsoever. ",
            "It lines up well with Celmins\u2019 own statements \u2013 as the author says herself, she does not use her works to reveal her feelings or what she thinks about the current President (\u201cExplore the Art\u201d). ",
            "In contrast, Mayreder chooses the genre, composition, and subject matter in a way that makes it very easy to see a political statement in A Garden Still Life with a Kitten . ",
            "If one knows about her feminist convictions \u2013 which, in any case, are a more famous part of her life \u2013 it becomes fairly simple to interpret the painting as a statement on women\u2019s social status. ",
            "Hence, the comparison between Mayreder\u2019s A Garden Still Life with a Kitten and Celmins\u2019 Ocean reveals how artistic choices may facilitate or negate the possibility of making a statement out of a piece of art.\n",

            "A Horror Film as a Form of Modern Public Lynching Essay\n",
            "Horror films have become one of the fundamental genres of cinema, the popularity of which is not inferior to the other styles. ",
            "The reason for it is the specific reaction of the target audience, namely a powerful emotional impulse. ",
            "Moreover, it becomes a psychological relief for some persons, which helps to distract from one\u2019s problems. ",
            "Horror films are not the modern version of public lynching; they formulate a way for people to obtain a strong emotional response through fear.\n",
            "Fear is a primary human emotion, which manifests itself as an instinct for self-preservation, namely a reaction to a potential threat. ",
            "It may seem strange for one that people pay money to feel such an unpleasant emotion while watching horror films. ",
            "However, in the essay Why We Crave Horror Movies , Stephen King argued that people aim to re-establish their feelings of essential normality (King, 1). ",
            "In other words, one tries to reset their ordinary feelings for many reasons. ",
            "Some are distracting from problems in this way, others get a dose of adrenaline, and sometimes horror films become a way to throw out their emotions in a movie theater and not on other people.\n",
            "Any art must evoke emotion and promote the individual experiencing ethical pleasure. ",
            "Watching horror movies seems to have nothing to do with the ethical aspect. ",
            "However, the success of horror movies, to more extent than other genres, depends on the audience\u2019s reaction (Glasby, 7). ",
            "The strong reaction makes horror films stand out in terms of the criteria for assessing art. ",
            "Indeed, few people can lag behind absolutely indifferent when watching scary scenes. ",
            "Besides, the powerful emotional response makes horror films so popular and successful nowadays.\n",
            "To conclude, one identified that horror films do not formulate a form of modern public lynching. ",
            "They are the one\u2019s method to receive the bright, emotive response. ",
            "There are various reasons for it, beginning from obtaining psychological discharge and ending to distracting from reality and one\u2019s urgent problems. ",
            "The audience\u2019s reaction is the key point to evaluating the horror film\u2019s success and why it is considered art.\n",

            "My experience with unjustly treated people was when I saw how an African American woman was not allowed to enter a restaurant due to some unknown reasons. ",

            "This concept should be inclusive of all races, genders, and other identifying features. ",

            "Minorities and people who do not meet society\u2019s \u201cnorms\u201d are frequently subjected to unequal treatment by those charged with protecting them. ",
            "In the book, Stevenson writes about groups of people who are vulnerable to being victimized by the system and how he helped people in prison to bring them justice. ",
            "It can be said that the system is inherently biased toward minorities, and it makes people suffer without any significant justification.\n",
            "A prominent example of this is the case of George Floyd. ",
            "When I first viewed the footage of George Floyd\u2019s killing, I felt a wave of pain and rage run through my body. ",
            "Not because I was surprised or outraged because Black women and men have been occurring since long before I was born; rather, I felt impotent.\n",
            "That someone in a position to protect and safeguard chose to do the exact opposite and murder someone so openly and publicly. ",
            "It\u2019s the same hopelessness that the spectators who witnessed Floyd\u2019s murder must have felt, and it\u2019s the same helplessness that George must have felt as he screamed in his final minutes. ",
            "The kind of powerlessness that makes you want to take action.\n",
            "One of the lessons of the Black Lives Matter movement is that being non-racist is not enough; we must all utilize our voices to be anti-racist. ",
            "Because silence might be construed as consent, we all must fulfill our moral obligations to those who are suffering as a result of the battle. ",
            "That doesn\u2019t just imply a performative social media post; it also entails asking ourselves how we might assist. ",
            "We can help the cause by having dialogues with friends and family, giving, being socially conscious shoppers, or writing to elected authorities about adopting policies that will result in change. ",
            "This is what exactly Stevenson described in his book, calling for rational consideration of each criminal case, not being biased, and helping people.\n",
            "We can no longer turn our backs on what has happened in the last year. ",
            "The suffering of the less fortunate is documented and disseminated for all to see. ",

            "The contributions of its employees do not exceed a certain amount or a certain percentage (Ameriprise). ",
            "The plan is an attractive and relatively easy way for workers to reduce their taxes and savings in the long run. ",
            "Currently, this plan is a notable option that allows individuals to receive savings from employers for retirement.\n",
            "The plan supports retirement savings primarily in two forms: regular contributions to a company plan or DC 401(k) plan and by government or nonprofit organizations \u2013 referred to as 403b or 457b (U.S. ",
            "Department of Labor). ",
            "Both plans are funded by payroll deductions, which reduce employees\u2019 taxable income. ",
            "The plan also provides a transfer option, meaning employees who change jobs can transfer plan balances to the same employer or the same plan.\n",
            "Generally, a 401(k) member can begin withdrawing money from their plan upon reaching age without penalty. ",
            "Any withdrawal permitted before age is subject to an excise tax equal to ten percent of the amount distributed (above the ordinary income tax that must be paid). ",
            "This includes withdrawal to pay expenses due to hardship unless the distribution does not exceed the amount allowed as a cap under section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code on an employee for amounts paid during a taxable year for medical care (IRS). ",
            "Amounts withdrawn are subject to the regular income tax of the member.\n",
            "Some employers may ban one, some, or all of the previous causes of difficulty. ",
            "To maintain the 401(k) income reduction tax benefit, the law provides that, unless an exemption applies, money must be held in a tax reduction plan or equivalent plan until the employee reaches age. ",

            "The income tax deferral option has no benefit if the member has the same tax rates on retirement as it did on initial contributions or interest and accruals. ",
            "Capital investment income from a 401(k) account is not subject to capital taxes (U.S. ",
            "Department of Labor). ",
            "This ability to avoid this second level of tax is a major benefit of the 401(k) plan. ",
            "Compared to investing outside of 401(k) plans, one pays more income tax, but one pays less tax overall with a 401(k) due to the ability to avoid taxes on capital gains.\n",
            "For pre-tax contributions, I will pay no federal income tax on current income he or she puts aside in a 401(k) account but still pays the general 7.65% payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicaments). ",
            "I am planning to earn $50,000 in a year and save $3,000 in a 401(k) account that year reports only $47,000 of income on the annual tax return.\n",

            "Most pension plans provide significant tax benefits. ",
            "More often than not, money deposited into an account is not taxable income for the employee at the time the contribution is made. ",
            "However, if the employer provides plans, the employer may receive a tax credit on the amount contributed, as if it were regular workers\u2019 compensation. ",
            "This is known as pre-tax contributions, and the amounts allowed to be contributed are quite small among the different types of plans. ",
            "Another significant advantage is that the assets in the plan can grow through investment without the taxpayer being entitled to year-on-year growth. ",
            "Once the money is withdrawn, it is fully counted as income for the year of withdrawal. ",
            "There are many restrictions on contributions, especially for 401k and defined benefit plans (Ameriprise). ",
            "These limits are intended to ensure that high-paid workers do not receive too much tax advantage on spending by lower-paid workers.\n",

            "At the same time, financial liability is given priority in bankruptcy laws. ",
            "When moving from one job to another, this should be considered by the plan member as to whether to keep the assets in the old plan or transfer the assets to a new employer plan or individual retirement agreement (Ameriprise). ",
            "The fees charged by IRA dees can be substantially less than the fees charged by employer plans and usually offer a much wider choice of investment vehicles than employer plans.\n",

            "\u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d by Faulkner Essay\n",
            "A Rose for Emily is an excellent example of the Southern Gothic genre. ",
            "The Southern Gothic is a literal tradition that came into existence in the 20 th century and became popular in European literature. ",
            "The genre is rooted in mysterious secrets, supernatural events, frightening scenarios, and extreme character duress, which leaves the reader desensitized. ",
            "The genre focuses on ridiculous and morbid features such as secret passages, draft castles, and laced cobwebs. ",
            "The Southern Gothic genre explores the antisocial behaviors that confined against the social norms and hinged on the belief that daily life and these social customs were just imaginary. ",
            "A Rose For Emily creates the theme of mental illness, murders, love-loss that ends up creating a frightening environment for the client, thus suits a Gothic Tale.\n",
            "Firstly, A Rose for Emily illustrates the Southern Gothic genre through the townsfolks accessorizing Homer\u2019s murder. ",
            "After Emily\u2019s father died, she isolated herself from society, and her house began to decay to smell awful. ",
            "The judge sent some township men to clean the place, but instead, they sprinkled lime over the property. ",
            "The township could have helped Emily and discarded the father\u2019s body, but rather, they worried if she needed help (Sullivan 175). ",
            "It is clear that the townspeople are fond of Emily and respect her. ",
            "This aspect can be seen when she purchased the rat poison \u201cSo the next day we all said, \u201cShe will kill herself\u201d; and we said it would be the best thing.\u201d (Faulkner 6). ",
            "They were in awe of her, but they harbored feelings of powerful aggression. ",
            "The town did not want to associate with her, yet they cared for her, which pushed her to buy the arsenic to kill Homer Barron. ",
            "Instead of doing the right thing, the town decided to cover the crime. ",
            "Them turning a blind eye on Homer Barron\u2019s death shows the element of the extreme character duress in the Southern Gothic genre.\n",
            "Secondly, A Rose for Emily contains the theme of lost love, representing Southern Gothic stories. ",
            "When Emily met Homer, a foreman, marriage was possible. ",
            "Still, then issues of her social status arose, and it can be seen when the town murmured, \u201cOf course, a Grierson would not think seriously of a Northerner, a day laborer\u2026 grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige\u201d (Faulkner 5). ",
            "Homer\u2019s perspective on his love towards Emily was not accurate, but he spent time with her. ",
            "However, it was said that Homer was gay and he liked men (Faulkner 6). ",
            "Emily saw the relationship from a romantic perceptive, while Homer saw it as spiritual. ",
            "It made Emily terrified of being alone as unrequited love is painful (Liu 198). ",
            "It led her to purchase wedding items for her and Homer, invite him to dinner, and poison him with arsenic. ",
            "Hence, A Rose for Emily portrays a romantic love skewed with dysfunctionality as described in the Southern Gothic stories.\n",
            "Similarly, lost love is also portrayed between Emily and her father, just as Southern Gothic themes. ",
            "Emily\u2019s father controlled her life, making it almost impossible for her to interact with the town and also forbid her from a romantic relationship \u201cWe remembered all the young men her father had driven away\u201d (Faulkner 4). ",
            "There was a falling out between Emily\u2019s father and the extended family due to property; hence she was only left with her father to teach her on love. ",
            "He also took the role of protecting as seen in this text, \u201cfather a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip\u201d (Faulkner 4). ",
            "Emily leaning on her father\u2019s back portrayed more concern about his physical well-being and protecting her. ",
            "After he died, Emily was utterly lost as she did not know how to love in a normal way. ",
            "It explains her behavior of not having any trace of grief and why she would tell the town that her father was not dead for almost three days. ",
            "The love of an overprotective father that forbids her to interact is an example of a Southern Gothic story.\n",
            "In addition, Southern Gothic style is portrayed in A Rose for Emily through appropriation and transformation. ",
            "The narrator transforms Emily\u2019s innocence into a psychologically damaged spinster. ",
            "At the beginning of the narration, Emily is used as a protagonist. ",
            "She used to be the perfect young wealthy lady living with her father. ",
            "Her privileged status causes her to be emotionally and physically isolated; she becomes erratic with characteristic behavior (Huang 205). ",
            "At first, she denied the death of his father for approximately three days. ",
            "The town sided with her, claiming \u201cwe knew that with nothing left, she would have to cling to that which had robbed her, as people will.\u201d (Faulkner 4). ",
            "However, it was difficult for the town to explain how she slept and spent years with the corpse of Homer. ",
            "Her erotic behavior is also seen when she is asked to pay her taxes by the Board of Abelderm. ",
            "She gets mad, saying, \u201cI have no taxes in Jefferson\u201d (Faulkner 2). ",
            "Even after being told that no public agreement excluded her from paying taxes, she continued denying it. ",
            "Her mental instability is an example of a character in the Southern Gothic story.\n",
            "Furthermore, Faulkner uses Southern Gothic elements throughout the stories. ",
            "At first, the writer\u2019s description of Emily\u2019s house gives the reader the impression that it contains mysterious secrets (Xiaokang 95). ",
            "He describes it as \u201cIt was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies\u201d (Faulkner 1). ",
            "Homer\u2019s death took place in the same house, and his corpse was left there to rot. ",
            "The story\u2019s setting shows it was created in the Southern Gothic period. ",
            "Emily was the last bloodline of his family that had stayed in that town for generations. ",
            "The tax collectors went door to door collecting taxes which made him a southern gothic. ",
            "Such scenes and creating a mysterious atmosphere throughout the story illustrate that A Rose for Emily was a Southern Gothic story.\n",
            "The story illustrates Southern Gothic literature through slavery, racism, and oppressive patriarchal forces. ",
            "Southern Gothic still idolized racism and slavery despite its abolition, where black Americans were still viewed as a class of servants. ",
            "It is first portrayed by Colonel Santos stating that \u201d the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes\u201d (Faulkner 1). ",
            "He is racist as he favorably removes Emily from the obligation of paying taxes and makes up a story that his father had loaned the town some money. ",
            "The book\u2019s setting reflected the slavery element based on Tobe\u2019s treatment. ",
            "The narration describes Tobe as a negro which denotes racism in the Sothern Gothic era. ",
            "The author supports this when he says, \u201cThey were admitted by the old Negro\u2026The Negro led them into the parlor\u201d (Faulkner 1). ",
            "We see him being released from his duties after Emily. ",
            "Tobe had grown old over the years. ",
            "He was the only life seen on Emily\u2019s property as he could facilitate errands from the market since the death of Emily\u2019s father until he was of grey hair (Xiaokang 94). ",
            "When Emily died, Tobe disappeared once the victors started arriving. ",
            "\u201cHe walked right through the house and out the back and was not seen again (Faulkner 8). ",
            "He was released from his slavery duties, an element of the Southern Gothic stories.\n",
            "In conclusion, A Rose for Emily is an excellent example of the Southern Gothic genre. ",
            "It can be seen from the various Southern Gothic elements presented in the story such as theme of mental illness, death, and love-loss. ",
            "A Rose for Emily illustrates the Southern Gothic genre by reating it to Homer\u2019s murder. ",
            "A Rose for Emily portrays a romantic love skewed with dysfunctionality as described in the Southern Gothic stories. ",
            "Emily\u2019s father controlled her life, making it almost impossible for her to interact with the town and also forbid her from a romantic relationship. ",
            "It also contains elements that hint the Gothic nature, such as the house description, Emily\u2019s character, the poison she acquired, and Emily living in a crumbling house alone. ",
            "From the beginning of the story, it generally creates a frightening environment for the reader, vital to Gothic tales. ",
            "All these elements make Faulkner\u2019s work a Southern Gothic tale.\n",

            "Environmental sustainability refers to the point where renewable resource harvesting rate should not surpass that of regeneration and that the decline of non-renewable resources should require the same growth of renewable alternatives. ",
            "The utilization of natural resources has increased significantly over the past few decades. ",
            "Environmental sustainability is essential for the preservation of resources by the global community for the future generation (Ostad-Ali et al.). ",
            "This entails the lowering of economic impacts that might be unfavorable to the environment, as well as designing a business that reduces the use of carbon. ",
            "The production of cheap and clean energy that is available for all is the primary objective of sustainable development. ",
            "In her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure,\u201d Carson warns the public about the consequences of modern industrial pollution. ",
            "Since environmental climate became adverse due to rising economic stability, variants of achieving environmental sustainability emerged, namely human contribution to the ecosystem by removing harmful substances from agriculture and the use of rainwater harvesting systems.\n",
            "The environmental climate has changed from being conducive to causing many adverse effects on the ecosystems. ",
            "Manufacturing, which is commonly considered to be continuous development in different types of industries, tends to affect the environment in various ways, which results to change in the atmospheric climatic conditions. ",
            "These, in turn, affect agriculture; for example, in the regions with manufacturing factories, \u201cthe farmers complained that they were unable to raise any pigs\u201d (Carson 123). ",
            "Both the manufacturing and processing sectors rely on the environment to attain their raw materials. ",
            "Industries such as the papermaking industries depend on trees as a source of raw material for their products (Ol\u00e1h et al.). ",
            "Consequently, it causes a tremendous decline in the number of trees available globally, and the trees are viewed to be of significance towards the reduction of the amount of carbon dioxide available in the atmosphere. ",
            "Moreover, the attempts to return the trees and plants are unsuccessful, and their result is \u201canimals have almost invariably gone along with the plants\u201d (Carson 128). ",
            "Subsequently, there will be developments of harsh environment and climatic change such as heavy rainfall and drought.\n",
            "The rate of development has increased within various countries to establish a stable economic background. ",
            "It enables the creation of employment opportunities for individuals, which encourages capitalism to establish firms in various sectors of the globe. ",
            "The industries mostly dispose of their waste products into large water bodies. ",
            "Consequently, it results in the existence of chemicals and other metals, which causes tremendous effects on marine creatures. ",
            "The accumulation of chemicals in the oceans results in oceanic acidification, thus, making the sea inhabitable to marine animals. ",
            "Yet, \u201cfuture generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for the integrity of the natural world that supports all life\u201d (Carson 129). ",
            "Hence, humans should develop some solutions for this problem to preserve economic stability and ecological integrity.\n",
            "One of the approaches in achieving environmental sustainability is by viewing people as a part of the ecosystem, which does not only use natural resources but contributes to the system. ",
            "For instance, nitrogen is essential for the growth of many crops, and many farmers use nitrogen fertilizer on their farms. ",
            "Yet, Carson argues that \u201cchemical insecticides must never be used\u201d (129). ",
            "This is due to the fact that the use of nitrogen fertilizer does not fit into an environmentally safe zone (Ol\u00e1h et al.). ",
            "Sustainable agriculture entails a system dedicated to seeking the sustenance of farmers and resources through promoting economically viable and environmentally sound farming practices. ",
            "When farmers spread nitrogen fertilizers on their farms, some is washed into water bodies and fed on by bacteria. ",
            "After the bacteria feeds on the nitrogen, they emit nitrous oxide into the atmosphere (Ol\u00e1h et al.). ",
            "The gas has global warming latent almost three hundred times that of carbon dioxide. ",
            "There have been many attempts to control nitrogen fertilizers\u2019 contribution to global warming; however, it has not been a simple task. ",
            "The rate of application of nitrogen in farming determines the amount of nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere. ",
            "Therefore, to reduce the rate of nitrous oxide production, farmers must minimize the number of nitrogen fertilizers they apply to their farms. ",
            "Unfortunately, not many farmers are willing to do this as it would reduce their profits.\n",
            "Another example of human integration into the local ecosystem can be seen in the Rajasthan rainwater harvesting system. ",
            "The farmers managed to provide irrigation for the crops across the year by building small earthen dams called Johads. ",
            "Those dams captured rainwater, which soaked into the aquifer and, therefore, was saved from evaporating (Singh and Bhakar). ",
            "With the introduction of drill technology, people started to abandon Johads and make wells as deep as possible. ",
            "By doing that, the underground water level decreased and dehydrated the ecosystem in the area. ",
            "The situation changed with reintroducing the practice of rainwater harvesting in Johads. ",
            "After seven months, the first monsoon season came and refilled the new pond. ",
            "This inspired the community to continue the restoration of their abandoned rainwater harvesting system. ",
            "Johads ended a vicious cycle of lowering levels of groundwater (Singh and Bhakar). ",
            "Serving the ecosystem is a strategy that can help humanity achieve environmental sustainability and ensure its long-term well-being.\n",
            "In conclusion, integration into the natural ecosystem is a vital step in nature preservation. ",
            "The high rate of environmental degradation that is being experienced globally is caused by capitalist activities, which are continuously conducted in various sectors of the globe. ",
            "Preferably, the government and various ecological authorities need to come together and formulate environmental policies and laws and ensure their implementation. ",
            "Through this, they will be able to curb the effects of capitalism on the environment and hence decreasing environmental destruction.\n",

            "Good Country People is a short allegorical story, written by Flannery O\u2019Connor, about the dual nature of religious workers, loneliness, and egocentrism. ",
            "Indeed, even the characters\u2019 names possess a hidden meaning about their appearance, personality, or life. ",
            "The story commences with the description of two old ladies and their children who belong to two different social classes. ",
            "Mrs. ",
            "Freeman is a maid in Mrs. ",
            "Hopewell\u2019s house, and the former was described as a woman with two primary unpleasant facial expressions for the public. ",
            "Since the story was told from Mrs. ",
            "Hopewell\u2019s viewpoint, she was presented as a calm, polite, and tolerant person, noticing but forgiving other people\u2019s flaws, including her daughter Joy, who chose the formal name Hulga. ",
            "Their bitter coexistence was interrupted by a 19-year-old handsome man, Manley Pointer, who sold Bibles door-to-door and claimed to have the same heart disease as Joy but appeared to be a criminal. ",
            "Through symbolism, O\u2019Connor was able to convey the characters\u2019 unique features with their names, connection to parents with Hulga\u2019s wooden leg, Joy\u2019s mindset with her glasses, and Pointer\u2019s non-religiousness with the hollow Bible.\n",
            "The first symbol is the characters\u2019 names that partly represent their fates and personalities. ",
            "For example, the reader is not provided with the first names of Mrs. ",
            "Freeman and Mrs. ",
            "Hopewell. ",
            "They acquired their last names from marriages, indirectly pointing to the only function that women could have in the South at that time, indicating the forced fate that is opposite of their actual situation. ",
            "For instance, Mrs. ",
            "Freeman is not a slave, but she is not free because she is a maid, while Mrs. ",
            "Hopewell is hopeless. ",
            "The women\u2019s personalities were revealed in their dialogues and their children. ",
            "Both are polite and consider themselves good individuals who sometimes have to endure other people\u2019s rudeness or ignorance. ",
            "Mrs. ",
            "Freeman\u2019s daughters, Glynese and Carramae, red and blond girls, whom Joy associated with Glycerin and Caramel, indicating a lack of respect for their chosen life path (O\u2019Connor 2). ",
            "Moreover, Joy was never joyful in reality; thus, she changed her name to Hulga to complete the image of an ugly person to avoid the traditional path of all South women. ",
            "Specifically, she seemed to want to avoid marriage and childbirth.\n",
            "The second allegoric element in this story was Hulga\u2019s wooden leg. ",
            "This symbol represents her inability to become independent of her mother. ",
            "Indeed, she still lives with her parent, is unemployed, and does not have relationships with other people. ",
            "It appears that she was born with a congenital heart defect that, in the best-case scenario, would allow her to live until her forties (O\u2019Connor 5). ",
            "Still, Mrs. ",
            "Hopewell wanted her daughter to get married at the right age. ",
            "However, an accidental gunshot wound at the age of ten became a pivotal point in Joy\u2019s life when she was implanted with the wooden leg and escaped the usual fate of her female counterparts. ",
            "Despite a PhD degree, the girl did not work and lived with her mother, waiting for her own death. ",
            "The appearance of Pointer gave her a tiny hope for a new life. ",
            "However, the girl\u2019s dreams did not become a reality because Hulga was deceived by the young man and lost her artificial leg. ",
            "Nevertheless, the disappearance of her prosthesis was an allegory for the opportunity to detach from the parental home and start an adult life.\n",
            "The third allegoric element of the short story was Hulga\u2019s glasses that Manley stole along with her wooden leg. ",
            "Hulga\u2019s glasses are her vision and ability to see the world clearly, both literally and figuratively. ",
            "However, she was ready to refuse her beliefs for this man. ",
            "Thus, she allowed him to take away her glasses during the moment of intimacy: \u201cwhen her glasses got in his way, he took them off her and slipped them into his pocket\u201d (O\u2019Connor 13). ",
            "Since Pointer escaped, Hulga was left without glasses because she no longer could look at the world through the lens of her old mindset.\n",
            "The fourth symbol was the young man\u2019s suitcase with two Bibles. ",
            "Indeed, one of the Bibles was an empty container for whiskey, cards, and condoms (O\u2019Connor 15). ",
            "The hollow represented not only Pointer\u2019s absence of Christian beliefs but was also an allegory for the insincerity of some religious workers, who talk about God and are simultaneously involved in sinful acts. ",
            "Furthermore, this picture and the young man\u2019s altered behavior not only ruined Hulga\u2019s hope for a different future but also confirmed her atheist believes.\n",
            "In summary, O\u2019Connor\u2019s Good Country People represents the issues of the dishonesty of religious workers, the difficulty of detaching from parental supervision, and the obsession of individuals with their goodness and other people\u2019s faults. ",
            "This story showed a painful experience of a young woman with poor health who failed to build social connections despite several university degrees. ",
            "Four symbolic elements in this short story uncovered Hulga\u2019s journey to detachment from her mother and old beliefs. ",
            "The first was the characters\u2019 names that described their appearance and personalities. ",
            "The second was Hulga\u2019s artificial leg as an anchor to her mother. ",
            "The third was Hulga glasses, which the young man stole from her smoothly, becoming the critical facilitator of disillusionment. ",
            "The fourth was Pointer\u2019s suitcase with fake Bibles as a symbol of the falsity of his religiousness. ",
            "Overall, the evil act of the young man left Hulga in rage and disappointment but with a more realistic perception of the world.\n",

            "Tocqueville during his visit to America said, \u201cAmericans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition are forever forming associations. ",
            "There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types\u2014religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute\u2026. ",

            "He then goes into great detail about this erosion, and he concludes by outlining the research required to investigate these theories thoroughly.\n",
            "This important book demonstrates that social capital decreased dramatically in the United States after the mid-to-late-1960s due to generational succession, the rise of television and urban sprawl, and the increasing demands placed on people\u2019s time and money, among other factors.

            "Numerous social problems have been implicated from the same, and as a result, ranging from poor educational outcomes to economic stress and tensions between and among social groups. ",

            "According to the author of Bowling Alone, there has been a decline in social capital in contemporary America. ",
            "The book investigates the causes and consequences of this decline and potential solutions.\n",
            "According to Putnam, there is a critical distinction between social capital that bridges everyone and bonds bind everyone together, including only those people. ",
            "Outward-facing networks, as opposed to inward-facing networks primarily concerned with their members, are more likely to contain more inclusive social capital networks. ",
            "Ethnic fraternal organizations and country clubs are two examples of this type of organization today. ",
            "Diverse social cleavages, also known as bridging social capital networks, on the other hand, are outward-facing and include people from a wide range of social backgrounds. ",

            "It is imperative to develop bonding social capital, which is unfortunately much more accessible to develop than other types of social capital. ",

            "Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. ",
            "Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. ",
            "Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content.\n",
            "Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. ",
            "In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. ",
            "I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. ",
            "He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. ",
            "Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. ",
            "Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. ",
            "Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third.\n",
            "Modern logic as an independent field of knowledge arose from such different sciences as philosophy and mathematics. ",
            "Being indeed a highly advanced concept, modern logic, however, lacks some characteristic philosophical features \u2013 it is more straightforward and technical. ",
            "Modern logic is often called mathematical logic, thereby emphasizing the originality of its new methods compared to those used previously. ",
            "In this sense, it is of less interest for discussion because it relies on exact sciences and computer technologists and avoids ambiguity. ",
            "Thus, modern logic is built on artificial language and intelligence, which in itself is rather boring compared to traditional concepts.\n"

            "In Liu and Asimov\u2019s short stories, the authors define human beings and how artificial intelligence differs from the human mind. ",
            "The author of The Algorithms for Love , Liu Ken, writes that humans are too young and too immature to understand the global laws of the universe. ",
            "However, it seems to many that human self-sufficiency and autonomy in desires and actions is prohibitive. ",
            "Asimov\u2019s Liar is unique in that it is one of the author\u2019s first attempts to reflect from different angles on the modern world\u2019s clash of high technology and morality. ",
            "Liu and Asimov approach the problem of artificial intelligence differently, but they agree that there is a strong similarity between the thinking of robots and humans.\n",
            "Liu Ken wonders where the boundary is between artificial and natural intelligence. ",
            "He is interested whether the robot\u2019s self-learning program can be considered a person (Ken 5). ",
            "After all, in essence, the decisions it makes are based on experience and knowledge \u2013 humans reason the same way. ",
            "The author goes on to ask his readers whether humans can be considered robots with artificial intelligence, in case one considers that there is no essential difference between the latter and people (Ken 5). ",
            "Thus, Liu Ken brings readers to his final question of who programmed humans in this case.\n",
            "Ken\u2019s story is about a young woman named Elena, a programmer and designer for a company that creates unusual toys \u2013 robot androids. ",
            "Improving from model to model, she finally manages to create a robot that can easily cope with the Turing test, able to communicate like a real person. ",
            "However, she is the only one who understands that this apparent intelligence is only the result of talented and competent programming. ",
            "Analyzing the results of her work, Elena comes to a frightening question. ",
            "She begins to worry that there is a possibility that people are not intelligent either and only work out the algorithms embedded in their internal program from day to day. ",
            "In this story, Ken Liu once again managed to combine serious science fiction with subtle psychology and the dramatic fate of the main character in a small story. ",
            "This literary work makes its readers embrace the idea of the identity of the artificial and human intelligence.\n",
            "Among the works of Isaac Asimov, one of the most significant and unique can be considered a collection of short stories I, Robot . ",
            "This work most fully expresses the social and philosophical views of the writer in the early stage of his work (Baysal 172). ",
            "The sixth story in the collection, Liar, makes it clear that human psychology, philosophy, and social laws interest Asimov more than the technical side of the literary work. ",
            "Some of Asimov\u2019s thoughts in this story are conveyed through the statements of the robot RB-34. ",
            "Herbie says that science is of little interest for him in one of his monologues (Asimov 65). ",
            "This hero is much more concerned with fiction and the intertwining and interplay of human motivations and feelings. ",
            "The monologue under analysis reflects Asimov\u2019s penchant for social and philosophical issues and his belief in art and commitment to the ideas of humanism.\n",
            "The authors are united by the themes of the stories and the issues they raise, although the writers\u2019 attention span is slightly different. ",
            "Asimov pushes readers to the idea that the ideal robot is a human being. ",
            "At the same time, Liu cautions about the consequences of recognizing the equality between how humans think and how robots do. ",
            "Nevertheless, both authors try to define what is human and what are the fundamental advantages and disadvantages of being people.\n",

            "Aspects of Belief of Jainism Essay\n",
            "When learning about religions and philosophies, I find that origins or backgrounds are essential in interpreting the context and content of a religion. ",
            "For Jainism, it was vital to learn that it is substantially older than a more well-known and contemporary Sikhism. ",
            "Though both have close ties with Hinduism, Sihkism\u2019s origins date back to only about 500 years ago while Jainism has a history of nearly 2500 years (Molloy 191). ",
            "Sikhism exhibits a more militaristic approach to monotheism despite being more modern. ",
            "As such, the Jainist belief that no Creator exists and that the universe is simply guided by natural forces becomes especially interesting as it rejects a very traditional integration of deities into theology.\n",
            "Following this, it is also interesting to me to observe in what ways a religion interacts with the world through its perspective. ",
            "As mentioned above, Jainism rejects the belief in a Creator or God. ",
            "This belief is held up by several philosophical questions that are even asked in atheistic circles. ",
            "These include contradictions in typical monotheistic religions such as God being both perfect and creating an imperfect world or God loving all life but still allowing suffering. ",
            "Jainism even poses a logical fallacy, which suggests that if everything in the universe had to be created, would God not also need to be created? ",
            "This worldview is surprisingly modern and potentially controversial for its time.\n",
            "Ethics is another vital component of any philosophy or belief system. ",
            "Jainism establishes five distinct principles of ethics which are Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truth), Astheya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (chastity), and Aparigraha (non-possession). ",
            "I am especially interested in Ahimsa which is the core of Jainist ethics. ",
            "This is because I believe that many religions excuse violence due to their beliefs, which is inherently immoral to my values. ",
            "Jainism proposes that non-violence is a priority and therefore inexcusable.\n",

            "Furthermore, it is unclear whether the mere presence of a personalized message or the message content itself drove the outcome. ",
            "To evaluate this possibility, the authors could have asked waiters to write different messages, some with no useful content, such as wishing a good day or drawing a smiley face. ",

            "Varying attitudes may affect the final tip, thus undermining the causal relationship. ",

            "For instance, if the waiter were a young female adult, applying the same conclusions to male waiters and older servers would be challenging, given the potential gender factor. ",
            "If the study was conducted at a private country club, extrapolating the result onto the high-class restaurant and casual diners alike would be unreliable. ",
            "If the meal was buffet-style, the overall tipping percentage might have been lower due to the perceived lesser effort of a waiter, thus impacting its wider applicability.\n",
            "Lastly, the study only used two groups, servers, and dining parties, with no size specification. ",
            "The authors could have employed a third group of solo dining parties, thus separating groups from those dining by themselves. ",
            "Such an addition would allow addressing the question of the groups\u2019 size effect and individual, interpersonal interactions. ",

            "The novel Atonement , written by Ian McEwan, touches upon the topic of the significance of writing. ",
            "The author uses various literary devices to convey many themes within the novel. ",
            "Using the omniscient narrator, the author strives to show a person\u2019s emotions who tries to atone the sins through writing. ",
            "The image of the main character of the novel, Briony, shows how the writing can help people to accept their own sins. ",
            "The author uses the different types of irony and omniscient narrator mode to reflect the idea of alleviating grief and guilt through writing.\n",
            "The significance of writing and narrative to coping with guilt, loss, or trauma is expressed primarily through two literary devices. ",
            "The first one is the irony: situational and verbal. ",
            "The irony is a satirical technique by which the writer evaluates the subject involving double meaning. ",
            "The truth lies not in the statement but in its opposite meaning. ",
            "The author uses verbal irony to convey the emotions of the characters in more detail. ",
            "\u201cNow you\u2019re sticking to the salad while the rest of us are suffering\u201d (121). ",
            "This type of irony is used to condemn the narrator\u2019s behavior. ",
            "Such writing structure is a way to plead guilty in the actions causing the sufferings to others. ",
            "\u201cWhen the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere\u201d (227). ",
            "This quote also contains the narrator\u2019s conviction to her actions against the loved ones.\n",
            "Creating a novel, the narrator wants to grant characters the opportunity to live lives they had no chance to live. ",
            "The narrator emphasizes that she has stolen the lives of the people she loved. ",
            "People cannot be brought back to life, and the narrator has no chance to be forgiven. ",
            "Thus, she creates a novel where she can atone her sins. ",
            "The situational irony is used to depict the narrator\u2019s remorse trying to use the writing to cope with the loss. ",
            "At the end of the book, the narrator confesses that the reuniting of characters had never happened (310). ",
            "The happy ending exists because she decides to atone for her own sins through the novel. ",
            "Being unable to change their lives, the writer creates a new life for these people in the story.\n",
            "Another element helping to express the mentioned topic is the omniscient narrator mode. ",
            "In such novels, the narrator simultaneously acts as a character and identifies himself with the first person pronoun \u201cI\u201d. ",
            "Such a narrator makes it possible to effectively express the thoughts and feelings of the narrator, hidden and inaccessible to an external observer, opening the way to various forms of self-observation. ",
            "\u201cHow can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?\u201d (325). ",
            "This example shows that the narrator considers writing as an alleviating measure helping to overcome the loss. ",
            "However, the narration mode allows the reader to understand that the narrator wants to be with the loved ones and cannot overcome being separated with them. ",
            "Actually, the reader realizes that the atonement was impossible for the narrator. ",
            "Through writing, she devotes her life to the people whose lives she ruined. ",
            "Even though Briony\u2019s mental trauma cannot be potentially atoned, she alleviates her grief and guilty through writing.\n",
            "The discussed issue is vital for me personally and the whole society in terms of understanding the writer\u2019s emotions. ",
            "Life is uncontrollable, and many events that haunt people all their lives may occur. ",
            "Everyone finds their own way to overcome the traumas. ",
            "Writing is the perfect opportunity to stay faithful to loved ones and express one\u2019s regrets. ",
            "It is morally relieving when the audience reads and accepts the author\u2019s confessions. ",

            "It goes without saying that Beowulf may be regarded as one of the most prominent ancient European poems. ",
            "Although its origin remains the subject of multiple discussions, the common version describes it as \u201ca Danish poem in the Anglo-Saxon dialect\u201d (Neidorf 847). ",
            "The poem describes the glorious life and deeds of a hero, Beowulf, who was regarded as a person sent by heaven for people (Gummere line 13). ",
            "Helping Hrothgar, king of the Danes, he kills the monster Grendel and his mother. ",

            "Although he follows the beast and finally slays it, Beowulf dies, being mortally wounded.\n",
            "From a personal perspective, this poem reflects several essential aspects of human life. ",
            "The first one is the issue of identity \u2013 in Beowulf , people were entirely associated with the glory of their ancestors. ",
            "They do not exist independently from their family lineage and kinship bonds. ",
            "Thus, their desire of Beowulf to be recognizable and honored forces him to search for deeds and fame. ",
            "Thus, another important theme of the poem is the maturity and responsibility that come with age. ",
            "At the beginning of the poem, the main hero desires personal glory and has nothing to lose. ",
            "However, after becoming a king, he realizes the importance of being a wise ruler who is responsible for his people\u2019s lives. ",
            "Finally, one more topic of the poem is the tension between personal value systems and the heroic code and between Christian and pagan values. ",

            "The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). ",
            "Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. ",
            "This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness.\n",
            "Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. ",
            "One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. ",
            "Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious \u2013 both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). ",
            "These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. ",
            "In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. ",
            "In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes\u2019 destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. ",
            "However, the fundamental difference is that a hero\u2019s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. ",
            "This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. ",
            "The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated.\n",
            "The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. ",
            "According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. ",
            "It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. ",

            "Beverly Daniel Tatum, a prominent expert on education and psychology, argues that racial identity is one of the most pressing matters in contemporary society. ",
            "The issue of discrimination against people of color is ubiquitous despite democracy and international law. ",
            "Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is the author\u2019s sincere monolog about injustice, which provides insight into its grounds, effects, and approaches to overpower it.\n",
            "The book reveals the issue of inequality from multiple angles, and it is demanding to pick out a few leading ideas, as Tatum tries to cover distinct topics in a certain number of pages. ",
            "She starts with a definition of racism and explains that it is challenging to have an honest conversation about race due to its negative stigma. ",
            "Furthermore, the author\u2019s point is to define the state of discrimination in the country and the world nowadays and explore what steps need to be taken to develop identity. ",
            "The book educates readers on how black people perform in white society and how white ones act in their community, noting the various subtleties and characteristics of security and privilege.\n",
            "Moreover, one of the central themes is the concern of patience and silence. ",
            "People need to understand that black children sit together because they feel understood and can develop a part of their identity that remains unformed without these connections. ",
            "They think that other individuals are incapable of sharing their values, and therefore it is unsafe to be a part of their circle. ",
            "One of the first efforts to comprehend systemic discrimination is eliminating the fear, shame, and protection around the word racist. ",
            "Whether white or colored, everyone is exposed to the smog of stereotypes, misinformation, prejudice, and disregarded history.\n",
            "There is a tendency, especially among whites, to deny the existence of systemic racism because accepting it as truth is like admitting that they are racist, and that needs to be altered. ",
            "The author\u2019s idea is that there must be a clear distinction between the negative attitudes, assumptions, and stereotypes that one person may project on another and how racism operates in society. ",
            "If everyone understood discrimination as a set of policies and practices that systematically give white people an advantage over people of color, the matter would become apparent.\n",
            "Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race raises fundamental issues of discrimination that are particularly acute in education. ",
            "The negative racial biases that black children face lead to frequent suspensions, resulting in excessive absences and the fact that they cannot receive the same quality of education as their white counterparts. ",
            "After reading, it becomes apparent that it is necessary to create encouraging conditions for communication between diverse students. ",
            "It is the educator who can control the nature of this interaction directly. ",
            "The book helps comprehend that education is the most promising tool to fight racism and build inclusive societies. ",
            "Children can and should be taught equality, respect, and tolerance from a young age. ",
            "Moreover, the author\u2019s thoughts inspire a shift in the approach to learning so that students of color feel empowered rather than victimized. ",
            "Equally meaningful is communicating to white children and explaining their role in discrimination counteracting.\n",
            "Education contributes to building a global community in which integrity, ethics, non-discrimination, and respect for the rule of law are essential pillars. ",
            "The author\u2019s central message emphasizes the educator\u2019s role in developing the students\u2019 ability to operate existing or acquired knowledge to alter their behavior. ",
            "It is necessary to promote proper conduct in appropriate circumstances, such as making ethical decisions and speaking out against discrimination. ",
            "Fighting something as pervasive as systemic racism may seem like an impossible task for an educator, but Tatum emphasizes that everyone can start with their sphere of influence. ",
            "Every individual has some impact on the lives of others and is capable of taking small steps that will dismantle racist systems.\n",
            "The book has undoubtedly valuable sense, though some of the author\u2019s ideas seem exaggerated, such as ubiquitous racism in the media. ",
            "Daniel Tatum illustrates the discrimination through the Lion King example. ",
            "According to the author\u2019s beliefs, the good characters are voiced by white people and are portrayed in a lighter shade, and the evil ones are expressed by minorities and are darker. ",
            "This sample seems irrational because it is evident that no discrimination was intended.\n",
            "Moreover, no one would think about the skin color of the person who voices the cartoon, let alone any hidden social or racial controversies that it might represent. ",
            "This example demonstrates that not all of Tatum\u2019s arguments are valid, and one should not look for racism everywhere. ",
            "If one parses all movies or any media for that matter, one would assume that they are all built on discrimination, even if they are not. ",
            "It is necessary to encourage proper intentions and equality rather than seeking racism.\n",
            "In conclusion, Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?: And other conversations about race is a book that explains the hardships that people of color experience. ",
            "Despite the controversial ideas, the author describes the causes of inequality in an accessible manner and points out that everyone can enhance the situation if they take action. ",
            "Thus, this book is helpful to everyone, especially the educator, who lays the foundation of the relationship between diverse groups of children.\n"

            "The former means accepting responsibility for decisions, and the latter suggestion is multi-faceted and should begin with updating databases to increase their variety and conducting independent assessments to confirm efficiency. ",

            "Blood Transfusion and Blood Banks Development Essay\n",
            "The history of blood transfusion dates back to ancient times when people tried to treat animals with blood. ",
            "Hippocrates recommended that patients suffering from mental disorders drink the blood of healthy people (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "Blood was commonly credited as having a rejuvenating effect. ",
            "It is also believed that blood is a miraculous liquid: once it is applied, life can be extended for many years (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "I find those facts especially interesting in the context of how blood transfusion and blood banks would be further developing.\n",
            "The development of donation was accompanied by numerous ups and downs \u2013 from the deification of this method to the state ban on its use. ",
            "The first documented intravenous injections refer to the beginning of the world\u2019s first academy of sciences \u2013 the Royal Society of London, founded in the 60s of the 17th century (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "It was not easy to make an intravenous infusion of blood to a person in those days: before the invention of a hollow injection needle and a modern syringe, there were still two centuries left. ",
            "Christopher Wren, in 1656 used a bird\u2019s feather as an injection needle and bladders of fish and animals instead of a syringe (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "Although the first attempts gave good results, blood transfusion was not widely used. ",
            "It was a technically rather complicated operation, and in several patients, the transfused blood caused severe complications.\n",
            "Moreover, the works of early researchers showed that blood transfusion remains an exotic method of medicine, in which the result depends not on the doctor\u2019s knowledge and skills but on random yet unknown factors. ",
            "It is known that there are compatible and incompatible blood types (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "For these and many other reasons, blood transfusion was not a method of daily medical practice. ",
            "The main and perhaps the only indication for blood transfusion was only acute blood loss.\n",
            "The last century\u2019s world wars and technological progress greatly accelerate the study and application of blood transfusion. ",
            "Thanks to different methods of blood storage, as well as the invention of freon freezing chambers, blood began to be transported over long distances and stored for a longer time. ",
            "In 1932, the world\u2019s first blood bank was established in a Leningrad hospital (Community Blood Center, 2020). ",
            "Soon after establishing the Institute, Leningrad scientists A.N. ",
            "Filatov and N.G. ",
            "Kartashevsky acquired a world priority in producing and using blood components: erythrocyte mass and plasma (Community Blood Center, 2020).\n",
            "Strict adherence to blood collection and transfusion instructions has made blood transfusion relatively safe. ",
            "This procedure has acquired the features of almost a universal method of treatment. ",
            "It began to be advertised not only for the treatment of blood loss and anemia but also for strengthening strength, nutrition, fighting infection, and preventing various diseases. ",
            "And so it went on almost until the mid-80s, until the AIDS epidemic radically changed the attitude towards blood transfusion.\n",
            "Currently, the blood service is one of the dynamically developing sectors of health care that is focused on ensuring the quality, safety, and availability of transfusion care. ",
            "Priority areas at the present stage of the development of transfusion medicine are the maximum automation of work processes based on the development of information systems, the use of high-tech equipment, and the improvement of the product quality management system.\n",

            "The company\u2019s top management made changes with minimal employee involvement. ",

            "Recent fad diets have suggested that carbohydrates cause harm to one\u2019s body. ",
            "However, this statement has been refuted many times for several reasons. ",
            "Firstly, to get a beautiful, efficiently functioning body, one needs nutrients \u2013 fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and water (Nazario). ",
            "Carbohydrate metabolism converts carbs into vital energy for the nervous system and brain, as well as for the possibility of proper metabolism of proteins and fats. ",
            "Once these elements are eliminated, there is a high risk of developing continuous fatigue, which potentially leads to depressive mood.\n",
            "Secondly, giving up carbohydrates leads to extra pounds because after completing a carb-free diet, the body is susceptible to every gram of carbohydrates, and super-compensation occurs in the diet. ",
            "In addition to an increased appetite for carbohydrate-containing foods, the assimilation of this element increases significantly (Nazario). ",
            "For example, a person was on such a diet for a month and lost ten pounds, and then immediately returned to a regular diet, regaining the same weight within a week. ",
            "Thirdly, even after the first day of giving up carbohydrates, a person may feel a slight malaise and headache (Nazario). ",
            "Later, there is a chance of developing constant headaches leading to migraine.\n",
            "Ultimately, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the brain. ",
            "All cognitive functions slowly fade away when the main \u201cengine\u201d ceases to receive sufficient charge. ",
            "Almost every activity demands increased brain activity which is stimulated by carbs (Nazario). ",
            "When a person does not consume them, primarily the level of concentration reduces. ",
            "Constant burning of ketones instead of glucose can lead to impaired brain function. ",

            "Rolling Stones were in the shadow of the Beatles from the very beginning, and this fact disturbed them a lot. ",
            "On the other hand, most of the fame went to the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones constantly felt their superiority. ",
            "To be different, they tried to become the anti-Beatles. ",
            "The legendary Beatles were a pioneer of hard rock: the musical influence of the song Helter Skelter led to the emergence of heavy metal (Covach and Bell 28). ",
            "The influence of The Rolling Stones on the formation and development of rock music cannot be overestimated. ",
            "It was significant not only in music, like the Beatles but also in artistic and visual, image and mass media terms.\n",
            "In songwriting development, the Rolling Stones tried hard to keep up with their competitors, but it was not easy, and they seemed to be one step behind. ",
            "A lot of what they did was a reaction to what the Beatles had already done. ",
            "For example, when a sitar began to sound in the Beatles\u2019 composition, it immediately appeared in the Rolling Stones. ",
            "The Beatles, with their working-class origins in provincial Liverpool, sought to maintain an elegant image (Covach and Bell 28). ",
            "They dressed in decent suits, cut their hair neatly and short, and communicated politely with everyone. ",
            "The Rolling Stones did the opposite: they wore black leather clothes and looked and behaved provocatively.\n",
            "In 1964, when The Beatles first came to the US, it was called the British invasion (Covach and Bell 28). ",
            "The Beatles took all five first places in the Billboard singles chart at once and became the only ones who were able to set such a record (Covach and Bell 28). ",
            "The Rolling Stones also achieved success in the US, mainly through shocking exposure, but they did not shake the Beatles\u2019 position. ",
            "Many of the rock bands of the 60s, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, are seen as irreconcilable rivals. ",
            "The reasons to think so are quite weighty: they played different music and had different images. ",

            "The 1999 movie Girl, Interrupted presented life in a psychiatric hospital from the perspective of its patients. ",
            "The main character is Susanna Kaysen, a girl who has graduated from high school, decided not to go to college and attempted suicide. ",
            "The last incident became the reason why her parents sent her to a mental institution, where she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. ",
            "The way Susanna was portrayed in the movie using lighting, music, external and internal factors, messages, and relationships with others presented her as a teenager with a severe but not hopeless psychiatric condition.\n",
            "The protagonist is a beautiful thin girl with short hair, pale skin, and a unique sense of style. ",
            "As the plot reveals, Susanna is talented in writing, painting, and music. ",
            "However, this framing was created in the movie to demonstrate that even individuals like Susanna may struggle with multiple emotional issues, including low self-esteem, nonadherence to societal rules, and anxiety. ",
            "Still, some elements of this character\u2019s appearance suggest that the girl is sad and anxious. ",
            "Specifically, her eyes rarely express happiness, especially at the film\u2019s beginning.\n",
            "Lighting was also a critical element in Girl, Interrupted , but it was not used to highlight one character. ",
            "Indeed, during night or day, the light was shed on those involved in a particular conversation or silent scene rather than on one character. ",
            "This technique probably was used to show that even though this story was mainly about Susanna, she was a small part of this world, where people self-harm, starve themselves, lie to others, and be violent.\n",
            "Music in Girl, Interrupted is primarily depressing to reveal the protagonist\u2019s state of mind. ",
            "Susanna\u2019s conversations with therapists always accompany the clock ticking, which usually means that the character is in danger. ",
            "In this case, the girl is haunted by her mind, several months or weeks from harming herself again. ",
            "Although most of Susanna\u2019s communication does not have musical framing, there is dramatic music when she makes crucial statements and decisions about her future.\n",
            "The film\u2019s editing was made to represent Susanna\u2019s unease about her memories and thoughts. ",
            "The story\u2019s timeline is not linear but goes backward to show the girl\u2019s flashbacks about difficult moments in her life. ",
            "Moreover, the movie starts with one of the final and pivotal situations where the main character sits in darkness with other patients. ",
            "It changes to the scene when doctors try to save her life after her suicide attempt when she claims her bones have disappeared. ",
            "This transition wanted to demonstrate that Susanna was unsure if she was sane or crazy.\n",
            "The movie creators used exterior and interior factors to build the character. ",
            "For instance, although Susanna, an unconventional and dramatic name, is beautiful, her appearance, attitude, and behavior suggest that this teenage girl may have emotional problems. ",
            "Indeed, she looks anxious around people and wants to make herself invisible by putting more powder on her face to make it paler and wearing clothes that can maximally cover her body. ",
            "Susanna\u2019s inner world revolves only around drawing and writing about random situations without any specific purpose. ",
            "Still, her relationships with Lisa reveal that the main character is lost, but she is against cruelty. ",
            "Even though her interaction with Lisa initially made her violent and rude, Susanna later realizes that she does not plan to stay in the hospital forever. ",
            "Thus, her final message was that she wanted to be a part of the ordinary world despite its ambiguity, which set her path to recovery.\n",
            "In summary, Girl, Interrupted is not only a movie about psychiatric patients but also the story of a teenage girl who struggled to find her place in the world. ",
            "Susanna was a beautiful and talented but anxious young woman. ",
            "Her framing, interaction with other characters, and the film\u2019s editing were made in such a way to show that the protagonist was aware of her mental issues. ",
            "However, only true acceptance of these problems allowed her to recover.\n"

            "According to available data, the owner of Ali Express online retailer, Jack Ma, can be cited as an example. ",
            "Plenty of evidence suggests that most of the items available to order are made by underage children from the poorest parts of the world. ",

            "It is difficult for an imperfect leader to hear and understand a person\u2019s intentions through the prism of ignorance and selfishness. ",
            "It is the absolute wrong approach, leading to nothing but a dead end. ",

            "The mythological aspects of the main characters and their significance for Odysseus are essential for understanding the poem. ",
            "In the epic poem The Odyssey by Homer, Odysseus encounters Athena, Poseidon and Polyphemus are surrounded by unique myths and occupy a distinct place in Odysseus\u2019 journey.\n",
            "While Athena and Poseidon are gods, Polyphemus is a Cyclops encountered by Odysseus. ",
            "Considering the contrasting origin of these characters, Athena and Poseidon are well-known for their divine powers; Polyphemus, on the other hand, is known for his leadership over the Cyclops and being the son of Poseidon. ",
            "Odysseus first meets Athena disguised as a little girl; in contrast, Poseidon\u2019s first encounter with Odysseus occurs when the god attempts to avenge Polyphemus, who was killed by the protagonist on the island of the Cyclopes.\n",
            "Although Odysseus interacts with several gods throughout his path, the goddess Athena remains particularly important due to her position as the hero\u2019s patron. ",
            "Athena has always protected the protagonist from danger, ensuring his successful journey. ",
            "For instance, when talking to Athena, Odysseus says: \u201cStand by me\u2014furious now as then, my bright-eyed one\u2014 / and I would fight three hundred men, great goddess\u201d (Homer 224). ",
            "From this perspective, the goddess shares a unique relationship with the protagonist and is vital for Odysseus\u2019s path.\n",
            "Another God whom Odysseus encounters on his journey is Poseidon, the god of the seas. ",
            "However, Odysseus and Poseidon share a drastically contrasting relationship, with Poseidon demonstrating tremendous wrath towards the protagonist, who blinded the god\u2019s son. ",
            "As such, Poseidon says to Odysseus: \u201cI\u2019ll give that man his swamping fill of trouble!\u201d and \u201cWith that he rammed the clouds together\u2014both hands / clutching his trident\u2014churned the waves into chaos\u201d (Homer 86). ",
            "By doing so, Poseidon attempted to hinder the hero\u2019s journey, which is one of the numerous examples of the god\u2019s critical role in Odysseus\u2019 path.\n",
            "Finally, Polyphemus attempted to harm the hero and his companions; however, Odysseus succeeds at tricking the cyclops. ",
            "Polyphemus said to that \u201c\u2018Nobody, friends\u2019[\u2026] / \u2018Nobody\u2019s killing me now by fraud and not by force\u2019\u201d (Homer 149), which prevented Polyphemus from receiving help from his friends. ",

            "Infection\n",
            "This virus does not have its apparatus for the synthesis of organic molecules. ",
            "Therefore, for self-replication, it uses the resources of the host cell. ",

            "In the nucleus, the actual reproduction of the virus occurs \u2013 DNA replication. ",

            "To build them, the virus uses the membrane of the nucleus of the affected cell, violating its integrity. ",
            "Due to damage, the cell fills with fluid and soon dies. ",

            "The combination of the highest qualities that an ideal human being should possess is an almost unachievable goal, yet the one that is held in high regard by many. ",
            "This essay will describe the Confucian gentleman and compare this idealistic archetype with Plato\u2019s philosopher-king.\n",
            "This idea that stems from the traditional Chinese culture continues to hold its importance for society. ",
            "Such a man stands above evil ideas, recognizes them, and counteracts their effects to the best of their abilities (Yu-kit 225). ",
            "Moreover, the Confucian gentleman helps others to do so through the transfer of knowledge (Yu-kit 223). ",
            "Yu-kit writes that a noble person, according to Confucius, must take \u201ca dual role of an exemplar and educator\u201d (224). ",

            "Notably, Plato\u2019s archetype is more leaning toward education rather than living life as a role model for others.\n",

            "The decline of the 14-15th centuries, also known as the crisis of the late Middle Ages, is a term used in Western historiography to refer to the recession processes that took place in some countries of Western Europe. ",
            "Western historians, considering the socio-economic processes in some European countries in the 14-15th centuries, paid particular attention to the \u201ccrisis phenomena\u201d in the European economy of these periods (Cole and Symes). ",
            "They put in the first place the movement of prices, population, \u201cdesolation\u201d of lands, and others as determining factors of recession (Cole and Symes). ",
            "Although the Middle Ages were once seen as a time of ignorance and social oppression, it is now understood as a dynamic period during which the idea of Europe as a separate cultural unit appeared.\n",
            "Since the 20s of the 14th century, the economic downturn in the history of Europe has begun. ",
            "The population was declining, while cultivated lands were mainly abandoned. ",
            "Cities were falling into decline, agricultural and industrial products were reducing, technological progress was suspended, the development of trade, primarily foreign exchange, was slowing down, prices were falling. ",
            "Additionally, the period is characterized mainly by overcoming feudal fragmentation and the formation of centralized states in France and England. ",
            "Using the financial resources of the cities, the kings could constantly maintain a mercenary army to fight rebellious feudal lords. ",
            "The appearance of firearms at the beginning of the XIV century reduced the importance of chivalry. ",
            "Castles could not withstand artillery, and the appearance of hand-held firearms made heavy knight armor meaningless.\n",
            "After the period of rapid population growth, Europe faced the depression phase. ",
            "It has been traditionally believed that the late Middle Ages is vividly characterized by demographic decline. ",
            "There were three significant factors for the recession: plague epidemic, famine, and numerous wars. ",
            "In addition, the weather conditions were also to blame since winters became harsh at the end of the 13th century. ",
            "The soil was inappropriate for planting crops which took a toll on the nutrition of European residents. ",
            "At the time of the Great Famine, thousands of people died daily from lack of food, parents sold and ate their children, cannibalism was widespread. ",
            "Hence, the population struggled to survive and did not focus on materialistic goals.\n",
            "The other reason for the decline was the plague which quickly spread around Europe and killed millions of people. ",
            "It is believed that the epidemic has penetrated almost every corner of the continent, killing from 30 to 50 percent of the population (Cole and Symes). ",
            "The mass fled from the cities gripped by the disease gave rise to anarchy, panic, and mob rule. ",
            "For fear of getting sick, anyone who aroused even the slightest suspicion was dragged to the infirmary by force. ",
            "The suicide epidemic, which intensified along with the spread of infection, forced the authorities to adopt special laws that threatened those who took their own lives to put their corpses to the public eye. ",
            "Together with the sick, healthy people often got into the infirmary, who was found in the same house with the ill or dead, which forced people to hide the sick and secretly bury the corpses. ",
            "Therefore, the contemporaries again had the only goal \u2013 survival.\n",
            "Ultimately, the revolts created severe conditions for the Europeans in the late Middle Ages. ",
            "The pressure on the poor caused peasants to rebel against the nobles. ",
            "Being a peasant was viewed as something pejorative, which opposed wealth and status. ",
            "While the aristocracy was accustomed to a luxurious lifestyle, the poor considered their fraud. ",
            "Hence, these two classes were fighting against each other with increased violence. ",
            "However, the nobles beat those from lower stratification since they had more power. ",
            "In addition, the War of Roses, Hundred Years\u2019 War, Polish-Teutonic Wars, and some others have greatly devastated the European territory leading to political, economic, and social dissonance. ",
            "Consequently, the population was trying to make ends meet to survive.\n",
            "For all its versatility, spirituality and culture of the Middle Ages were built around one vector. ",
            "Religion permeated all spheres of life in medieval society and changed their perception of crisis (Gaddy 72). ",
            "The Church continued to eradicate heresy to a large extent, repressing religious sects and urging priests to punish unorthodox followers (Gaddy). ",
            "Meanwhile, the peasantry practiced pagan customs and began mixing them with Catholic ones. ",
            "The Church has become the center of social contradictions, weakening the political influence of the Papacy in the 14th century. ",
            "It further led to the development of independent centralized states.\n",
            "The religious assumptions have also given rise to the progress of art and sciences, initiated by the development of universities and the spread of scholarship. ",
            "The revived interest in ancient literature led to the Italian Proto-Renaissance (Cole and Symes). ",
            "Antiquities, including books, have been accumulating in Europe since the Crusades (Cole and Symes). ",
            "The invention of printing also contributed to the spread of knowledge. ",
            "Previously rare and costly books gradually became publicly available, preparing the European reformation.\n",
            "The first Italian humanist, Francesco Petrarch, revived man\u2019s science \u2013 humanities. ",
            "Humanists believed that eternal truths were hidden under cover of the poetic fiction of ancient literature. ",
            "They rejected the totality of academic knowledge with its ontological problems and brought to the fore ethics, the science of the formation of human personality based on a thoughtful reading of Roman authors with their ideal of human dignity. ",
            "The defining feature of Italian humanism was the possession of classical instead of medieval Latin. ",
            "Contemporaries appreciated Petrarch for his treatises on history and ethics, written in beautiful classical Latin. ",
            "Petrarch studied the norms of elegant Latin from Cicero, whose works he tirelessly searched in the monastery libraries (Robinson 249). ",
            "For his Latin writings, Petrarch was crowned with a laurel wreath in Rome.\n",
            "What is more, the New Testament was viewed as a source of faith formation, especially during the crisis. ",
            "Since the Catholic faith was spread by people, the New Testament was the book to rely upon when praying (Luther 358). ",
            "The church was gaining more power causing individuals to convert and making them serve for the sake of God (Gaddy 114). ",
            "It also helped shape the concept of chivalry and contributed to the rise of women\u2019s status in society (Luther 359). ",
            "Consequently, the population was trying to find peace resorting to religion during the decline.\n",
            "In conclusion, the crisis of the Middle Ages caused devastating consequences on Europe; however, it gave rise to cultural formation. ",

            "In the chapter \u201cThe Origin of Negro Slavery\u201d, Williams explains that although currently slavery is deeply connected to the exploitation of African Americans, initially, populations of various races and ethnicities were occupied as enslaved people (Williams 7). ",
            "Considering that individuals of all races were involved in slavery in the New World, racism emerged as a consequence of forced labor and was not originally connected to the targeted discrimination of African Americans.\n",
            "In the history of slavery, the first population compelled to undergo the severe process of enslavement was the Indians. ",
            "For instance, Spanish explorers utilized Indian labor in their colonies to convert the population to Christianity, enforcing the necessity of slave labor on the individuals who refused to accept the Christian faith (Williams 8). ",
            "Similarly, Great Britain and France supported slavery in the colonial territories; however, this event was not connected to racial predispositions but to the fact that slavery served as a preventative penalty for the indigenous communities. ",
            "Nevertheless, over the course of history, enslaved Negroes became a highly more important asset in the slave trade due to the economic benefits, leading to the establishment of Negro slavery as a normal condition (Williams 21). ",
            "As a result, racism and racial discrimination emerged, but the initial origin for substituting other enslaved people with African Americans remained economic, not racial.\n",
            "To conclude, the connection between slavery and racism lies in the fact that racial predispositions towards African Americans were caused by the overwhelming use of enslaved African Americans. ",
            "As such, slavery did not emerge as a result of racism; on the contrary, individuals from various races and ethnic communities were involved in the slave trade. ",

            "To see how this relates to the current topic, I suggest looking at the following short excerpt from a news summary.\n",
            "PCR tests and antibody tests\n",
            "Probably all of us have encountered PCR tests and antibody tests that do not inspire confidence. ",
            "Such products may be sold in supermarkets and pharmacies, but they do not seem to be as reliable as lab tests. ",
            "Ultimately, no airline will accept home test results as proof of health because such tests can be easily faked. ",
            "Faking tests can be done by manufacturers to save money or by buyers to deceive the public: no matter, either way, it involves anti-morality. ",
            "As the video says, a sick individual with a false-negative test can cause harm to others, which can lead to their death. ",
            "Thus, this ethics of own reasoning in synthesis with personal responsibility also applies to the COVID-19 problem.\n",
            "Importance of wearing masks\n",
            "A news article from NBC News talks about how wearing masks can help in the fight against a pandemic. ",
            "One of the sub-themes of this piece is the coverage of Americans\u2019 anxiety and stress over the two-year pandemic and the strict necessity of wearing masks in connection with it (Edwards, 2022). ",
            "Indeed, medical masks have already become part of the daily practice of people around the world, and a general rejection would mean victory over COVID-19. ",
            "However, many individuals refuse to use personal protective equipment in favor of their personal needs. ",
            "Because of this, incidentally, the number of scandals on airplanes is increasing because without each passenger wearing a mask, planes are not allowed to take off (Levenson, 2022).\n",
            "The topic raised by NBC News reveals the issue of personal responsibility to oneself and to society, as wearing a mask, according to the CDC, has a proven track record of effectiveness (Edwards, 2020). ",
            "Each individual has the moral right to determine whether he or she is willing to take responsibility for his or her life through mask-wearing but cannot go against public laws. ",
            "In other words, when individuals refuse to wear masks (whether they are vaccinated or not), they put others at risk. ",
            "This raises issues of infringing on the freedoms of other individuals and intentionally harming them. ",
            "Consequently, individuals have a social responsibility to wear a mask in order to work together to combat the active spread of COVID-19.\n",
            "The problem of forced vaccination\n",
            "Meanwhile, the problem of forced vaccination against coronavirus infection raises questions about the influence of power. ",
            "One of the fundamental freedoms of any individual is the absolute responsibility for one\u2019s own life if capable. ",
            "In other words, no one may compel an individual to commit acts against his will unless such acts threaten national security. ",
            "Encouraged by the desire for public health, national governments have imposed mandatory vaccination regulations on an increasing number of categories of the population; naturally, this raises ethical questions about the ability of authorities to influence the private lives of individuals in this way.\n",
            "This is particularly evident in the protest by truckers in Canada who have expressed dissatisfaction with the vaccination law. ",
            "A news article describes Canadian truckers protesting against the strengthening of government power over civil society because they expect that \u201cthings will never go back to normal, they are being ganged up on by the government, the media, Big Tech, Big Pharma\u201d (Panreck, 2022, para. ",
            "7). ",
            "This example reflects the problem of resistance to authority and opposition to an opinion that is studied in the course. ",
            "However, it is difficult to call either side of the conflict right because both truckers (like all anti-vaxxers) and governments have a fairly reasonable motivation for their opinions.\n",
            "Government support\n",
            "Any attempt by the government to support national health care may not seem entirely fair. ",
            "The authorities in many countries were totally unprepared for the pandemic, causing health care systems to fail at the beginning of COVID-19. ",
            "The high number of deaths, the shortage of medicines, and the lack of adequate information undermined people\u2019s trust in the authorities. ",
            "However, the action of the authorities to protect public health can be justified by the increasing media coverage of the health risks of COVID-19. ",
            "From a biological point of view, as Nature (2022) writes, having suffered COVID-19 increases the risk of developing dangerous effects, among them cardiovascular disease. ",
            "Consequently, ignoring preventive action and effective treatment measures to contain the problem now could lead to exacerbation of chronic disease in the near future.\n",
            "The issue of pollution\n",
            "The impact of COVID-19 on ecosystems is meaningfully broader than meets the eye. ",
            "To understand what we are talking about, let us watch the following short excerpt from the BBC documentary:\n",
            "As you can see, the pandemic problem continues to affect non-obvious areas. ",
            "The need to wear masks all the time leads to the problem of their improper disposal, causing ecosystems to suffer. ",
            "Studies show that plastic particles from medical masks get into aquatic animals, leading to mass extinctions (City University of Hong Kong, 2022). ",
            "The problem is exacerbated by the intensification of globalization, with tourists traveling around the world, exacerbating the problem of pollution in natural areas isolated from megacities.\n"

            "One of the prominent examples demonstrated by McGhee is the history of public swimming pools in cities across the US. ",
            "At the beginning of the 20th century, there were massive public swimming pools in many US cities, yet at that time \u201cpublic\u201d mostly meant \u201cwhite only\u201d pools. ",
            "After numerous drowning incidents, local municipalities were told to open the pools for all people regardless of their race, which provoked a backlash from the white residents. ",
            "As a result, cities preferred to close or privatize the public facilities instead of allowing people of different races to use them freely. ",
            "This is an example of the destruction of public goods and a massive cost increase for the whole population due to the \u201czero-sum\u201d mindset.\n",
            "Another negative example demonstrated by McGhee is political in nature \u2013 many white people stopped pushing for social governmental policies regarding jobs and social benefits after the Black community joined the agenda. ",
            "In the end, this means less social justice and social benefits for the whole country because the adherents of the \u201czero-sum\u201d paradigm do not want other races to benefit from these policies. ",
            "The arguments provided by McGhee seem reasonable and fair to me \u2013 they describe the past and current state of affairs in the United States well. ",

            "Business and economics are similar in that they are supplements to each other, both dealing with the process of creating products and services and selling them to generate output. ",
            "These are fields of study that are closely related and include a range of shared subtopics, such as enterprises, marketing, finance, manufacturing, and banking. ",
            "Both are social sciences that focus on financial measurement and analysis, focusing on variables that impact the market and also focus on short- and long-term projections, as well as the inner workings of various industries. ",
            "Finally, both business and economics tend to focus on various problems facing the nation, its citizens, government, and private enterprises (Vaidya). ",
            "However, there are some differences between economics and business, which are based on their conceptual purpose.\n",
            "Economics is a study focusing on understanding human behavior and, in turn, how that reflects on the broader economic elements of whole nations. ",
            "Meanwhile, business is aimed at studying the process of the exchange of goods and money specifically, and all the related elements starting from production to the final sale, and how a specific enterprise fulfills this process. ",
            "It can be argued that business is a subset of economics, as the human behavior in that exchange of goods is a point of focus (Casson). ",
            "A major difference is in concepts, economics deals with theories and broad elements of the economy, such as supply and demand, interest rate, and international trade. ",
            "While these undoubtedly impact business, both individual entities and as a field of study, business focuses on the process of wealth creation within the context of the economy and typically applies practical theories.\n",
            "Economics focuses on and attempts to maximize the welfare of society, while business is centered on its shareholders. ",
            "Both face different issues, with economics encompassing poverty, unemployment, taxation, and federal expenditure, while business focuses on product positioning and differentiation, marketing, growth or lack thereof of profitability, and individual or industry performance (Gitman et al.).

            "This theory is utilized to understand the customers\u2019 buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. ",
            "For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened \u2013 and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. ",
            "Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. ",

            "It would be difficult to modify my diet to match the EAT-Lancet recommendations. ",
            "Mainly, this is because I would need to change my eating habits, meaning I would need to get used to eating and shopping for foods that are different from what I consume daily. ",
            "Additionally, with the EAT diet, many of the products need to be cooked or prepared; for example, vegetables taste better if they are in a salad, which would require more time for preparation. ",
            "Currently, I do not have much free time to dedicate to preparing food, which creates a challenge for me if I want a balanced and environmentally friendly diet. ",
            "However, I could shop for vegetables that are already slides or buy salads and healthier foods from the places I already order from or shop at, which would make it easier to integrate these products into my diet.\n",
            "One aspect that I can easily modify is my shopping habits since I often tend to buy too many fresh products that I do not eat before they perish, and thus I have to throw these away. ",
            "According to Lancet, with food, \u201cthe amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability.\u201d Hence, I need to pay more attention to the way I shop for fresh produce to minimize waste, which I can achieve by shopping more often but buying less produce to ensure that perishable items are eaten in time.\n",

            "The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. ",
            "In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. ",
            "Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. ",
            "For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. ",
            "Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters \u2013 guns, money, and other items that show one\u2019s motives or their identifying trait.\n",
            "The characters\u2019 close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. ",
            "This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. ",
            "When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. ",
            "In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. ",
            "Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. ",
            "The shot is divided into thirds vertically \u2013 and the characters stay in the first or third part.\n",
            "Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. ",
            "Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. ",
            "The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held \u201cshaky\u201d shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. ",
            "Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room.\n"

",
            "Understanding the working of the human brain gives a clear indication of how the brain is so developed as compared to other organisms and why humans remain superior to other organisms. ",

            "The cells of the epithelium have two surfaces, the structure, and function of which can vary1. ",
            "Such glands as the exocrine and endocrine are made up of epithelial tissue and are differentiated based on the manner of secretions\u2019 release. ",
            "There are eight types of epithelia, with six of them being identified on the basis of the number of cells and their shape and two being named by the type of cells found in them. ",
            "They include simple squamous epithelium, simple cuboidal epithelium, simple columnar epithelium, pseudostratified columnar epithelium, stratified squamous epithelium, stratified cuboidal epithelium, stratified columnar epithelium, and transitional epithelium. ",
            "Among the mentioned types of epithelia, the simple squamous epithelium will be discussed further.\n",
            "Simple squamous epithelium represents a single layer of flat cells that have the shape of scales. ",
            "This type of epithelial lines the inner surfaces of all blood vessels make up the wall of alveolar sacs in the lungs and lines the cavities in the body2. ",
            "The cells of the epithelium have a flat shape and are arranged using a single layer. ",
            "This layer is thin enough that it allows forming of a membrane through which the compounds can move with the help of diffusion. ",
            "Simple squamous epithelia allow for facilitating gas diffusion as well as small molecules.\n",
            "Simple squamous epithelium tends to be permeable and occurs where small molecules require passing quickly through membranes through diffusion or filtration. ",
            "The epithelium falls under the physiological category of exchange epithelium because of its capacity to transport molecules promptly across the tissue level. ",
            "To enable this movement, some kinds of simple squamous epithelium can be porous, which allows molecules to pass through it, thus enabling a leaky epithelium. ",
            "Simple squamous epithelium is best located in the air sacs of the lungs, the lining of the heart, as well as lymphatic and blood vessels. ",
            "Therefore, the primary function of this type of epithelium entails allowing materials to pass by means of diffusion and filtration and secrete lubricating substances.\n",
            "Because simple squamous epithelium is involved in the composition of the lungs, the heart, blood, and lymphatic vessels, it plays crucial functions in the body. ",
            "The lungs are a vital body organ, which is a part of the respiratory system, allowing a person to breathe. ",
            "They will enable the inflow of oxygen into the body (inhalation) and send carbon dioxide out (exhalation), while the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is called respiration. ",
            "Besides, the simple squamous epithelium is included in the composition of the heart, which is the most critical organ in the body which sends blood around it. ",
            "Blood functions as the key provider of the body with oxygen and much-needed nutrients and also carries waste.\n",
            "The blood and lymphatic vessels also play vital roles in the human organism, with simple squamous epithelium representing their core component. ",
            "The lymphatic system represents the component of the immune system, helping maintain the balance of fluid in the body and playing a part in the absorption of fats and fat-soluble nutrients3. ",
            "It encompasses an extensive vessel network passing through the majority of the tissues to allow for the movement of lymph. ",
            "When it comes to the importance of blood vessels, their function entails the delivery of blood to organs and tissues in the body. ",
            "The blood supplies the organs and tissues with oxygen and nutrients needed for the functioning of the organism.\n",
            "The image of the simple squamous epithelium is represented in the longitudinal section, which is done by achieving a plane along the long axis of the structure. ",
            "It represents a section done by a plane along the long axis of a structure as opposed to a cross-section, which is also referred to as the transverse section. ",
            "In histology, the longitudinal section is achieved by making a cut that is made parallel to the longest dimension of an organ or a specimen. ",
            "This is because many anatomical structures are significantly longer in one direction than the other. ",
            "Therefore, the tissue cut in the long direction, the longitudinal section of the simple epithelium will mean that the image should show that every cell touches the basement membrane. ",
            "In contrast, in a stratified epithelium, some cells should be shown resting on top of other cells without being in contact with the basement membrane.\n",
            "The examination of simple epithelial cells is usually possible through a biopsy. ",
            "After a sample is collected, it is being fixed in formalin and embedded in a medium such as paraffin. ",
            "Then, it is sectioned and stained to fit the further examination. ",
            "Besides, in histology, it is notable that keratin can be used for defining tissue as epithelial cells and differentiate between the different types. ",

            "Equine influenza is a respiratory disease that is highly contagious to horses and other animals in the horse family. ",
            "It is caused by numerous influenza subtypes, a virus comparable to but distinct from influenza viruses seen in other animals. ",
            "Contact with sick horses and infected clothing, equipment, brushes, gear, and so on transmits the virus swiftly. ",
            "When the illness strikes horses, it is known to cause considerable losses. ",
            "Horses may not display the corresponding signs when affected by the disease. ",
            "However, it is possible to prevent the spread of the virus by vaccinating the horses, treating the sick horses, and using any other preventive measure. ",
            "The essay will discuss the effects, ways of transmission, and how to treat and prevent equine influenza.\n",
            "Horses are affected by two varieties of influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B with two varieties of influenza viruses that steadily circulate and produce seasonal flu waves, influenza A and influenza B. ",
            "Influenza stresses the letters H and N are used to categorize viruses. ",

            "These are both proteins on the worm\u2019s external that help in the virus\u2019s raid of cells (Oladunni et al., 1657). ",
            "Occasionally the bacteria exchange genetic data, acquiring original traits that human immune mechanisms have never seen before.\n",
            "Equine fever is a viral infectious respiratory illness that spreads quickly among horses and has a short incubation period (1-3 days). ",
            "It is transmitted by diseased horses coughing, filthy buckets, brushes, gear, and so on. ",
            "Coughing horses volatilize the organism, which may spread the virus up to 150 feet and infect an entire barn in a matter of minutes (Blanco-Lobo et al., 933). ",
            "Infectious horses may shed influenza for 14 days after being infected.\n",
            "Finally, many horses are symptomless virus shedders, which means they are resistant and will not become sick; however, the virus may still multiply and transfer to other horses.\n",
            "Because equine influenza respiratory indicators are comparable to other respiratory disorders, they cannot solely identify illness on clinical signs. ",
            "The testing window is limited; the findings may be harmful if samples are analyzed very late in the disease\u2019s progression. ",
            "Diagnostic testing facilities isolate viruses mostly from nose swab samples acquired from ill horses shortly after infection. ",
            "Serum sample testing can also be used to make a diagnosis.\n",
            "Equine influenza is a worm with severe penalties, but with proper immunization and biosecurity, supervisors may affect the outcome of infections. ",
            "Shareholders, riders, handlers, and coaches can lessen the risk of sickness by succeeding the American Association of Equine Practitioners\u2019 immunization recommendations (AAEP). ",
            "Sticking to proper biosecurity follows, collaborating closely with the vets, and existence proactively (getting temperatures, separating horses) if they detect potential signs of illness. ",
            "Working with your vet to ensure that horse(s) is on a suitable immunization regimen is critical.\n",
            "Though vaccination is not a panacea, it is among the most effective existing defense against this condition. ",
            "If an immunized horse becomes sick, the situation is milder, and vaccinated animals shed influenza for shorter times. ",
            "A rise in events, along with an increase in horse movement, leads to epidemics of infectious illnesses such as equine influenza (Sacket al., 1185). ",
            "Effective biosecurity strategies, methods to decrease pathogen spreading, and understanding of sickness symptoms are necessary safety precautions.\n",
            "Finally, Equine influenza may infect both horses and humans. ",
            "It is easily spread through direct contact with sick horses and can swiftly infect a significant number of horses in a single grazing area. ",
            "Familiarize oneself with the approved indications of equine influenza and keep an eye out for them over the winter season. ",
            "If you believe that you have the flu, have your veterinarian take suitable samples and submit them to a specialist laboratory for examination. ",

            "Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cBag Lady\u201d Song Meaning and Context Essay\n",
            "I have selected Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cBag Lady\u201d and explored its original version, a live version, a 2018 cover by Nao, the singer\u2019s interview, and Erica Swift\u2019s interpretation of the message. ",
            "The original version presents the song just as a piece of art, so the message serves as the only context (\u201cBag Lady (Official Video)\u201d). ",
            "The live version accentuates the singer\u2019s positive reputation (\u201cErykah Badu Live \u2013 Bag Lady\u201d). ",
            "In contrast, the cover version places it in the context of exploring the pillars of neo-soul. ",
            "Due to Nao\u2019s introductory word, the accent might be shifted from the underlying message to Erykah Badu\u2019s contributions to neo-soul (\u201cBag Lady \u2013 NAO Cover for the Soul Train Awards\u201d). ",
            "Nao\u2019s cover uses novel sound recording equipment and technology, which, from my perspective, adds depth and emotion to the song by enabling the listener to distinguish the details of the performer\u2019s vocal control techniques. ",
            "Thus, technology has influenced the way that \u201cBag Lady\u201d is perceived. ",
            "The findings above deepen my previous knowledge about the song. ",
            "I have learned that young neo-soul singers might see the work in question as the essence of the genre\u2019s unique beauty.\n",
            "The song research activity has also challenged my previous perceptions of the song\u2019s meaning while also demonstrating that various interconnected interpretations of the song exist. ",
            "As for the originally intended meaning, the singer explains that the song is about \u201cpersonal growth\u201d and having \u201ctoo many things\u201d on one\u2019s mind (HIP Online). ",
            "Other people\u2019s perspectives, however, further elaborate on this non-specific message to incorporate transitions between various stages of life and recovery after traumatic events. ",
            "For instance, Swift\u2019s interpretation is that one \u201ccannot get to their destination [the next chapter in life] with too much baggage,\u201d and she understands \u201cbaggage\u201d as unresolved psychological traumas. ",
            "Interestingly, the meanings explained above are a bit different from my perceptions from previous encounters with the song. ",
            "For me, the song reflects on how taking too much responsibility and spreading oneself too thin leads to exhaustion and loneliness.\n",

            "Essay on the Career Goal: Nursing Essay\n",
            "In the modern world, the nurse\u2019s role is changing dramatically: From being a resident assistant to the treating physician, the registered nurse (RN) is becoming the critical link in the clinic. ",
            "RNs help provide a continuum of communication between patients, their families, and medical staff, which means that treatment and recovery outcomes depend on the effectiveness of their work. ",
            "Given the structural changes in the professional role of the registered nurse, I could not help but take an interest in this field. ",
            "Thus, my career goal is to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing as the first step to becoming a professional nurse.\n",
            "Nursing has become particularly important in recent years and became especially important to the clinical system during the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
            "By now, there are over 4.2 million registered nurses in the United States (USAHS). ",
            "This large number represents about 1.3 percent of the nation\u2019s total population, which means about one in 100 Americans is a registered nurse. ",
            "This data shows how critical this role is to society, as a large number of people from various states would not choose the profession if it were not in demand. ",
            "The Rafferty study indicates that \u201cnurses can realise their potential as change agents in building a better future for health care\u201d (Rafferty 475). ",
            "Additionally, USAHS reports that the number of male nurses has tripled over the past 50 years, which also reflects a positive trend in this professional role and rapid removal of stigma.\n",
            "There has historically been a bias against nurses regarding their importance. ",
            "Although the nurse\u2019s role is not controversial for patients who frequently encounter clinics and other stakeholders, healthy people can provoke stigma toward such staff. ",
            "This prejudice has nothing to do with the current level of medical development since the nurse has long since ceased to be an adjunct to the physician but has been given a separate role, a theoretical foundation, and new functions. ",
            "Opportunities for continual growth and helping sick people are features of today\u2019s RNs that appeal to my career choice. ",
            "Thus, my altruistic nature and desire to overcome stigma motivate me to continue my BSN training.\n",
            "Since my chosen career is feasible, I have to think about the organizational details of professional development. ",
            "I have to spend at least four years to get my BSN, which is the standard time frame for an undergraduate degree. ",
            "However, it is likely that I will want to continue my studies after the BSN, in which case I will need additional time. ",
            "To be specific, I will say that four years is the minimum I wish to cover, to begin with. ",
            "The cost also depends on the state and university, but the average cost is about $40,000 (NJ). ",
            "Hence, my plan is to continue to make savings at a compound interest rate that will help me have financial protection. ",
            "I plan to study all four years carefully and do my homework and tests to get the solid knowledge I will need in the future.\n",
            "To emphasize the bottom line, my central career goal is to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in registered nursing. ",
            "This is the most specific and pressing goal I have set for myself in terms of career advancement. ",
            "However, once I receive my BSN, I have no plans to graduate, as I want to advance my knowledge continually. ",
            "Professional development requires careful academic work on myself, but in addition, I will also need to save up some money. ",
            "To put it another way, in the next four years, I plan to work hard on my education in order to fulfill my personal career goal.\n",

            "Marketing is one of the most critical aspects of every business, which makes organizations look for effective ways to attract new customers. ",
            "However, not all marketing activities are fair or ethical, and targeting uninformed consumers is among them. ",
            "One should explain that uninformed consumers are individuals who lack the psychological or mental maturity to make reasonable decisions and purchases. ",
            "Examples of these people are children, the elderly, and individuals with psychological conditions. ",
            "Consequently, it is unethical to target such consumers because this practice can provide these people with adverse outcomes.\n",
            "Many factors explain why it is unethical to target uninformed consumers. ",
            "The first robust argument comes from the definition presented above. ",
            "Since these people do not have psychological or mental maturity, target marketing can force them to purchase unneeded items. ",
            "Consequently, this marketing approach is a form of manipulation of unprotected populations. ",
            "The second reason refers to the fact that it is challenging for uninformed consumers to locate sellers\u2019 lying. ",
            "As a result, organizations can provide customers with false information to stimulate their buying behaviors.\n",
            "Irrespective of this information, some people claim that there is nothing wrong with targeting uninformed consumers. ",
            "This point of view relies on the belief that such customers represent new markets, and organizations are free to enter and benefit from them. ",
            "However, it is challenging to deny that these consumers are vulnerable populations, meaning that they deserve a specific attitude. ",
            "That is why it is unethical to target uninformed customers.\n",
            "In conclusion, the essay has presented robust arguments of why organizations should refrain from targeting children, the elderly, and people with mental conditions. ",
            "Even though some people and businesses stipulate that these populations are suitable for marketing, it is better to avoid them. ",
            "The rationale behind this statement is that uninformed consumers do not have psychological maturity, meaning that target marketing can force them to make unreasonable decisions and purchases.\n"

            "Examination of Stella Artois\u2019 Marketing Campaign Essay\n",
            "Early positioning and image problems encountered by Stella Artois in the UK market can be used as prominent examples of contradiction between the sale price and advertisement campaign. ",
            "Although the brand was intended to be an expensive premium product, combining the high percentage of alcohol and lowering the cost created an impression that this product was designed for mainstream use. ",
            "Considering that other reputable brands tended to diminish alcohol content and increase the prices, in comparison to them, Stella Artois gained a low-quality reputation. ",
            "In this regard, it can be concluded that it is essential to analyze the entry market and potential competitors, examining the customers\u2019 expectations and evaluating whether product differences might prompt the emergence of unexpected impressions.\n",
            "The market development model is an excellent guide for industry growth, which allows for increasing the sales of beer. ",
            "Considering the audience\u2019s characteristics and the product\u2019s attributes, following the suggested advice for the current maturity level might offer relevant insights into the elevation of category volume and brand sales. ",
            "For instance, remaining aware of the customers\u2019 preferred method of beer consumption can aid in understanding the market segment and providing the exact product that the target population expects to receive. ",
            "In addition, it becomes possible to avoid failures connected to the presentation of irrelevant beer segments and product categories. ",
            "Furthermore, as different social groups begin to consume beer, the brand can be adapted to fit their requirements, establishing new segments, promoting consumption changes, and compelling the market development to advance to the next level.\n",
            "From my perspective, the complication in the launch of the brand in Mexico can be connected to the availability of the Water.org campaign. ",
            "As this proposition was only available in particular countries, which excluded Mexico, it is possible to suggest that the customers were not interested in receiving the marketed promotion. ",
            "Furthermore, it is possible that the characteristics of the campaign contributed to the failure, as customers were expecting different positioning for a new product, which openly addressed a serious issue rather than promoting its qualities. ",
            "Considering that tremendous amounts of water are used for brewing beer, marketing water access through beer consumption could have resonated with the consumers, creating a negative disposition towards the brand.\n",
            "Introducing Stella Artois into the South African market included several considerable advantages for the company. ",
            "Given that the water access in Cape Town was recently restricted due to the water crisis, providing the customers with an opportunity to receive an extra water supply tremendously increased the possibility of success. ",
            "Moreover, as the South African beer market was steadily growing, this was a perfect opportunity to enter it. ",
            "However, a significant disadvantage of centering the South Africa launch on the Water.org sponsorship concerns the use of a highly prominent water complication as a marketing tool. ",
            "Furthermore, South Africa remained at the first level of market maturity, meaning that introducing a premium brand contradicted the customers\u2019 expectations.\n",

            "Organizational structure is an essential notion that brings the team together to manage the objective successfully. ",
            "Five structural configurations help people to achieve team goals. ",
            "Depending on the purposes of the group, it is essential to choose the appropriate structure. ",
            "For instance, there are variations: One Boss, Dual Authority, Simple Hierarchy, Circle Network, and All-Channel Network. ",
            "These structures are different by their nature, and it is vital to examine each of the five to determine the most effective structure for the team to accomplish its goals.\n",
            "One Boss structure is a situation where the leader charges responsibilities of all people. ",
            "This structure is classic, and many companies apply it because of its simplicity and clearness. ",
            "Indeed, it can have some substantial disadvantages, for example, slow communication, delays, and single decision-making. ",
            "The second structure is Dual Authority, where two individuals have the power to execute control over the group of people. ",
            "Information flows through these people and reduces a boss\u2019s control degree. ",
            "This structure allows to free up time, but the added layer might slow the communication.\n",
            "Simple Hierarchy is another classic structure that suggests a middle manager reporting to the boss. ",
            "In this case, the boss is responsible for communication with other team members through the middle man. ",
            "This option limits access to authority; indeed, it is more effective than the previous structure of Dual Authority. ",
            "Circle Network suggests the information flow from one team member to another; everyone can add to or change the process. ",
            "This structural configuration might simplify communication, as every group member interacts directly with only two other team members. ",
            "There is no boss, and every group member has equal responsibility. ",
            "However, one weak element in the chain can undermine the whole process.\n",
            "The last structural configuration is the All-Channel Network, which is about interdependence and the involvement of every team member in the process. ",
            "All-Channel Network embodies multiple connections where everyone is dependent on each other. ",
            "It is about diversity and equal responsibilities; however, decisions can cause misunderstanding and extra discussion with other team members. ",
            "It also might slow down the process due to multiple opinions on the same issue. ",
            "This configuration is often compared to football and basketball, where the result depends on every group member.\n",
            "As a teacher, I am part of three teams. ",
            "The first is the One Boss configuration, where I am in charge of the director. ",
            "The teacher should report to the director, and the absolute authority is in the director\u2019s bylaw. ",
            "The second structure is the Simple Hierarchy, where I link my students and the director. ",
            "The last configuration is All-Channel Network, where teachers build communication to reach the educational objective. ",
            "The most effective structural configuration was All-Channel Network; despite some disadvantages, the decision was chosen fast. ",
            "In addition, this configuration allows diverse opinions and creates multiple ideas split into one great decision.\n",
            "A different configuration affects the process significantly; as seen, the decision-making process\u2019s speed and simplicity depend on the chosen configuration. ",
            "For example, when it is required to decide on the spot, the One Boss configuration might be a doubtful solution. ",
            "Instead, several team members will accomplish the goal faster and more efficiently. ",
            "In general, many educational organizations strive to give equal abilities to each team member; it creates a friendly atmosphere and contributes to the flow of ideas within the group.\n"

            "Perishable food products can be preserved for a long time by applying a preservation method to them. ",
            "Boiling fruits and berries with honey or sugars, urinating, pickling, pickling, and other methods have been used by people for a long time. ",
            "Food preservation has become ecologically important with difficult economic times, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1715). ",
            "Various methods of influencing microorganisms have been widely studied and have found practical use, making it possible to preserve food products without spoilage for a long time. ",
            "There are several classifications of food preservation based on microbiological and spoilage mechanisms, on which it is possible to describe the main methods of preserving products.\n",
            "The first group includes storage methods based on the basic principle: they aim at maintaining life processes at a reduced level but with the preservation of natural immunity. ",
            "This principle is based on the storage of fresh fruits and vegetables and live fish storage (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1718). ",
            "In the second group are storage methods based on the principle of abiosis, which aims to destroy microbes in the product. ",
            "These include pasteurization, sterilization, the use of antiseptics, antibiotics, and sonication.\n",
            "Storage methods based on the principle of anabiosis aim to suspend the vital activity of microbes in products. ",
            "At the same time, such conditions are created under which microorganisms can remain alive but not viable. ",
            "These include: creating low temperatures, removing water from the product \u2013 drying, creating a high osmotic pressure with salt sugar, increasing acidity, and creating anaerobic conditions (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1719). ",
            "Finally, storage methods based on the principle of cenoanabiosis are aimed at using antagonistic relationships between microorganisms that make up the microflora of the product. ",
            "At the same time, conditions are created for the development of microorganisms, which change the properties of the product in the course of their life activity to improve its nutritional and taste qualities. ",
            "The waste products of these microorganisms inhibit the development of spoilage pathogens (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1726). ",
            "The pickling of fruits and vegetables in fermented milk products is based on this principle.\n",
            "However, more innovative approaches are available today since the ones listed above have been known to history for a long time. ",
            "Ultrasonic technology and ozone treatment are applied to products sensitive to heat. ",
            "Even nanotechnology for food preservation is also being considered (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1726). ",
            "Nanoparticles are used as antimicrobial agents or in the fight against foodborne pathogens. ",
            "Ultrasound, in turn, increases the efficiency of proteins, reduces aging time, and is used for sterilization and pasteurization (Sridhar et al., 1723). ",
            "Moreover, an impulsive electric field is one of the newest methods of processing products. ",
            "Typically, it is applied in drying, using less time to process products (Sridhar et al. ",
            "1727). ",
            "Unlike thermal drying, this method is less energy-intensive but requires more control.\n",
            "In addition to classifying methods according to microbiological mechanisms of action on products for their preservation, several other classifications are also distinguished in the food industry. ",
            "First, each product is evaluated by its spoilage mechanism; secondly, conservation is limited to technologies related to the processing of products and their packaging. ",
            "Spoilage is a natural process for foods and can be measured by the rate of spoilage and its mechanism. ",
            "There are perishables, semi-perishables, and non-perishables. ",
            "The first group, as a rule, includes products of animal origin \u2013 meat, eggs, dairy products, and the last \u2013 nuts, beans, oils, and flour.\n",
            "The spoilage mechanism includes physical effects, microbiological and chemical, which trigger the corresponding processes in the product, reducing its edibility. ",
            "These mechanisms often work simultaneously, not excluding each other. ",
            "Moisture content, crystallization, and temperature are the main mechanisms influencing the product (Amit et al. ",
            "10). ",
            "Microbiological processes include the appearance of microorganisms and the environment in which they are convenient to multiply: such processes are usually referred to as fermentation. ",
            "Chemicals include proteolysis, putrefaction, oxidation, and rancidity (Amit et al. ",
            "11). ",
            "Each of the spoilage mechanisms can be stopped or suspended by various conservation methods.\n",
            "As a rule, the fight is against physical mechanisms, so this group has the most significant number of possible preservation methods. ",
            "Pasteurization, drying, and many others \u2013 most of them have already been listed above. ",
            "Biological intervention highlights only the process of fermentation; strictly speaking, fermentation is fermentation. ",
            "In other words, the decomposition processes of organic substances with a lack of oxygen, which usually occur in living organisms, are natural, and the problem in preserving the product is only the need to ensure the correct course of this process (Amit et al. ",
            "12). ",
            "Chemical methods involve control of the pH group and conservation. ",
            "For example, canning with ethyl alcohol is used to produce semi-finished fruit juices. ",
            "At an ethyl alcohol concentration of 12-16%, development is delayed, and at 18%, the vital activity of the microflora is suppressed. ",
            "However, the most common application of chemical preservation methods is the packaging approach (Geueke and Muncke 491). ",
            "Each material requires special processing due to the uniqueness of its properties in order to meet the requirements of sanitary safety a result.\n",
            "Therefore, the preservation of products is becoming increasingly important in the world. ",
            "The studied classifications suggest a division according to microbiological processes and spoilage mechanisms. ",
            "Both classifications offer solutions that have been used for many centuries and are innovative and relevant today. ",
            "Attention is paid not only to the processing of products but also to packaging. ",

            "Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. ",
            "Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. ",
            "The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively.\n",
            "On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). ",
            "On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. ",
            "As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed.\n",
            "The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class\u2019s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. ",
            "The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). ",
            "The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). ",
            "Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor\u2019s needs are overlooked. ",

            "The Monster is described as ugly and strong but at the same time, inexperienced. ",
            "Firstly, Frankenstein\u2019s creature is described as \u201cits gigantic structure and the deformity of its aspect \u2026 instantly informed me that it was the wretch\u201d (Shelley). ",

            "The creature can be compared to a baby who tries to examine the world it lives in, and its actions are just contractions to the cruelty of the world. ",
            "Frankenstein\u2019s monster is not a real monster; it just seeks love and attention that the world cannot give him. ",

            "I like that genre because I like looking at diverse issues from various perspectives. ",
            "This novel allows me to look at the actions of Victor Frankenstein and the Monster and understand their motives and feelings. ",
            "I also appreciate novels that aim to show moral aspects of society with the utilization of different symbols, such as the Monster.\n",
            "Mary Shelley\u2019s husband believed that inappropriate social relationships are the result of people becoming evil. ",
            "To make people bad, other representatives of society should reject them and make them feel useless or bad. ",
            "I agree with this opinion, as people\u2019s intentions are generally based on their experience of social interactions. ",
            "If society treats people as if they were misconducts, there is no reason to try to be good or fit in.\n",
            "I believe that one of the integral themes of the novel is loneliness. ",
            "The Monster aimed to integrate into society; however, people met him with disgust, fear, hatred, and all the spectrum of negative emotions. ",
            "Hence, the creature turned to evil because of the feeling of loneliness. ",

            "Gandhi\u2019s Thoughts on Inter-Religious Relations Essay\n",
            "An outstanding history concerning India touches on its moral icon, Mahatma Gandhi. ",
            "Also called Bapu, Gandhi was India\u2019s first prime minister after helping the nation attain independence through non-violence actions. ",
            "Instead of using armies, Indians used fasting to compel Britons to leave the country, making it (India) very unique. ",
            "Studies on ethics never proceed without mentioning Gandhi. ",
            "Bapu holds almost the same respect as Aristotle on morality and the need for social stability. ",
            "Bearing an association with Gandhi thus makes Indians very happy. ",
            "Many people and organizations in the republic purpose to promote the first primer\u2019s morality standards, with some attaining significant success. ",
            "However, Gandhi\u2019s philosophy on the nation\u2019s social, economic, and political realms is highly corrupted. ",
            "Therefore, the following discussion reviews the leader\u2019s principles on morality, inter-religious relations, and long-term influence. ",
            "Covering the leader\u2019s canons on the different aspects helps differentiate Bapu\u2019s real stands from today\u2019s tarnished interpretations.\n",
            "Morality has several meanings, including the system of standards and values differentiating good and ill. ",
            "Ethics is the philosophical brand under which character is studied. ",
            "Aristotle and Mahatma Gandhi are the two renowned morality leaders in history. ",
            "The former was a Greek scholar with profound influence on global ethics, while Gandhi\u2019s inspiration mainly thrives in India. ",
            "Mahatma was India\u2019s first prime minister after helping the nation realize independence through non-violent means. ",
            "Several literary sources contain the leader\u2019s values for the Indian and global citizens. ",
            "However, Tushar Gandhi stands out as a reliable primary source for those seeking Gandhi\u2019s philosophy on morality. ",
            "The author is the great-grandson of India\u2019s first prime minister and provides straightforward narratives bearing the reality on the icon\u2019s stands.\n",
            "Gandhi\u2019s morality covers several subjects, including politics, parenting, integrity, social interactions, and the use of fasting as a tool. ",
            "Bapu views political leadership as an opportunity to serve, not exploit people. ",
            "The leader also maintains the need for politicians to remain below the law to protect its (the law\u2019s) sanctity (144). ",
            "Gandhi starts his speech by apologizing to the audience concerning the family\u2019s inability to provide another icon. ",
            "According to the author, almost all the individuals in the Indian government and political arena go against Bapu\u2019s morality principles. ",
            "Gandhi (142) refers to the current public insults among the Indian leaders in fighting corruption as a significant deviation from Mahatma\u2019s principles. ",
            "Anna is a public icon who thinks that calling the other leaders names amounts to cleansing oneself. ",
            "Instead of tarnishing the other party\u2019s reputation, the speaker maintains that the best way is to ensure that one is clean and then use the proper channels to bring the corrupt folks to account.\n",
            "The use of fasting in contemporary India also goes against Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s principles of morality. ",
            "Gandhi (142) says that Bapu\u2019s mission thrives on making the means and the ends equally important. ",
            "Accordingly, the fasting public figures must know why they are doing that to cause the appropriate effects. ",
            "To reiterate this account, Gandhi (141) provides a narrative featuring Bibi Amutussalam, one of the nation\u2019s renowned female public figures. ",
            "Bibi was a social worker in Noakhali and a disciple of Bapu. ",
            "A social conflict involving the destruction of an Indian temple in the village and the stealing of liturgical swords from the worship center by Muslims takes place during Bibi\u2019s days, according to Gandhi (142). ",
            "The disciple then tries retrieving the swords by going into the Islamic villages but fails. ",
            "She then results to fasting to force the two conflicting communities to come together and the Muslims to return all the three stolen swords. ",
            "The community returns two swords until the twenty-first day of Bibi fasting, during which society members seek her to take something.\n",
            "Bapu\u2019s response on learning about Bibi\u2019s actions implies the need for considerate fasting. ",
            "Bibi refuses to eat until all the three swords taken from the destroyed temple are back. ",
            "Coupled with the disciple\u2019s importance in society, Bibi\u2019s many days of fasting make many people afraid. ",
            "The two rifting communities also come together to take care of Bibi, who remains adamant. ",
            "On learning about the incident, Mahatma Gandhi writes to Bibi, asking her to be clear on whether her fasting is to bring Muslims and Indians together or is meant for personal destruction (Gandhi 142). ",
            "However, Bibi decides to maintain the fast against Bapu\u2019s advice. ",
            "Consequently, Gandhi responds with the following words, which show the need for consideration when fasting for the public good.\n",
            "\u201cShe is unyielding. ",
            "And if she wishes to die, then let her pass on. ",
            "She does not comprehend or recognize that the intention is to bring together the hearts and not retrieve the weapons. ",
            "Let us not discard our time on her\u2026\u201d (Gandhi 142).\n",
            "Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s moral principles on the judiciary demand that the government\u2019s arm remains fair to all the people regardless of the political class or social status. ",
            "According to Gandhi (145), India\u2019s judicial system lives significantly contrary to Bapu\u2019s moral requirements. ",
            "The author notes that many poor people go to prison for minor offenses, while the powerful operate over the law. ",
            "Furthermore, even the acquitted low-class Indians continue staying in jail because no lawyers will help them get out. ",
            "Many acquitted fellows need someone to deliver their exoneration letters from the courts to the prisons, but no one is ready to undertake the job. ",
            "Instead, almost all the attorneys in India cherish working for the wealthy individuals exhibiting corruption cases. ",
            "The lawyers use their influence and law knowledge to secure the corrupt elite group\u2019s freedom (Gandhi 145). ",
            "Accordingly, India\u2019s courts and lawyers fail to live by Gandhi\u2019s moral philosophy and should change.\n",
            "Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s ethics on parenting also want parents to control the amount of freedom granted to children. ",
            "Gandhi (144) provides a narrative involving Bapu and Arun, his beloved grandson. ",
            "According to the author, Arun wants to take his grandfather\u2019s photograph after securing a camera. ",
            "He requests the senior Gandhi to take the snap, but Bapu denies requiring Arun to pay five rupees for the photo (Gandhi 144). ",
            "The requirement comes from the fact that Gandhi charges public members interested in acquiring his signed autobiography, a project that Arun manages. ",
            "The Arun one day takes his grandfather\u2019s photo when the icon is busy. ",
            "On learning about the grandson\u2019s action, Mahatma confiscates the camera until Arun\u2019s parents pay five rupees to the prime minister. ",
            "The matter makes the great-grandson very hungry because he believes he should never pay for something he owns; the grandfather. ",
            "Gandhi realizes Arun\u2019s madness, after which he softly tells Arun that failing to do to his grandson what he does to the public denies him the moral authority to exercise the policy on others.\n",
            "Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s moral principles object to the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d practice in Indian politics today. ",
            "Gandhi (145) compares Anna and Manish and Mahatma, Hitler, and Winston Churchill to show the difference. ",
            "According to the speaker, Anna and Manish present a mistaken version of Indian politics by engaging each other on the stage. ",
            "Instead of retaliating, Gandhi (145) insists on turning the other cheek to the oppressor for the sake of peace and morality. ",
            "Nonetheless, the speaker notes that ignoring the accuser forms the best way to turn the other cheek and not give up one\u2019s face for buttering (Gandhi 146). ",
            "Consequently, the account reiterates Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s non-violence actions, which Indians need to re-introduce for real ethicalness. ",
            "Other moral values from Bapu\u2019s ways include perseverance, moral victory, and conservation, which are lacking in contemporary Indian and global societies.\n",
            "Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s ethics on inter-religious associations maintain the need to quit dogma-based religion and faith to a belief system that appreciates humanity and its shared origin. ",
            "The former prime minister thus disregards violent religious systems that brand people and other religious groups as \u201cothers\u201d. ",
            "Other than taking religion as an alien aspect, Gandhi maintains that there can never be religion without humanity, thus the need for humans to recognize the essence of free interaction. ",
            "Mahatma serves as an example of what he preaches to the people about religions. ",
            "For example, the leader remained grounded in Hinduism but often read and analyzed other religions\u2019 writings and teachings (Howard 4). ",
            "Moreover, Gandhi encourages his disciples and followers to engage in genuine conversations with the other religions to gather more knowledge about God and humanity.\n",
            "Bapu further accepts and supports intermarriages between individuals from different religious backgrounds, bringing a better understanding of humanity and making religion a moral issue. ",
            "Howard further (5) reiterates Gandhi\u2019s message that understanding various spiritual teachings promotes diversity in reasoning and knowing God. ",
            "As such, the leader says that experimenting on the other religions creates adequate views worth supporting interreligious associations for mutual respect and deep understanding, instead of mere tolerance (Howard 5). ",
            "Gandhi\u2019s teaching on the religion subject thus forms a crucial part in the contemporary world where people fight others on religion basis. ",
            "Appreciating Bapu\u2019s moral principles on religion provides an excellent way for the world to avert the many religion-attached wars, such as those between Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and all the other groups.\n",
            "Studying Mahatma Gandhi and his moral influence is crucial for the continued application of his values. ",
            "According to Weber (147), Gandhism is significantly non-existent in the contemporary world, with Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan being two of the most significant followers of Gandhism in history. ",
            "The lack of literary material concerning the movement shortly after Gandhi\u2019s death explains the bulging void (Weber 247). ",
            "However, the absence of adequate literature regarding Gandhism rhymes with the leader\u2019s sentiments that his life should be his story (Weber 248). ",
            "The argument leads to noteworthy reviews and bibliographies on Gandhi\u2019s work and deeds in the twentieth century, with some writers viewing him as an influential figure over the period. ",
            "Consequently, Mahatma Gandhi continues to influence people differently, including politically and religiously, as per Weber (253). ",
            "Nonetheless, reviving the works about the leader promises to cause more impact relative to today, thus transforming the world.\n",
            "In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi remains one of the most outstanding leaders worldwide. ",
            "The fellow\u2019s moral teachings and life serve as adequate influencers towards morality. ",
            "Gandhi is specially credited with the non-violence demonstrations using fasting and hunger strikes. ",
            "The leader utilized this strategy to secure India\u2019s independence, which he calls moral victory. ",
            "India continuously shifts away from Gandhi\u2019s ethical principles in several aspects. ",
            "For example, the nation\u2019s current politicians engage in corruption and public insults against Gandhi\u2019s \u201ccheek philosophy.\u201d Other issues covered in this work concern Gandhi\u2019s stands on interreligious links and his long-term significance.\n"

            "Ghalib is an Indo-Persian poet that was writing in the Urdu language and became popular and influential in the XIX century. ",
            "The lifestyle and conduct of Ghalib were inspiring people, saving faith and belief in their hearts during harsh times. ",
            "The poem chosen for this assignment is \u201cThe \u201cGodless\u201d Lover.\u201d The name of this work refers to the Islamic government dubbing Ghalib godless. ",
            "Still, in many lines of the poet, one can find Koranic characters and reflections about the relationship between a human and the Creator. ",
            "Ghalib, in this poem, emphasizes the meaning of God to his soul and puts special stress on the initial presence of God. ",
            "All the people, according to Ghalib, are the result of creation that would not have mattered if they existed or not without God. ",
            "It is especially evident in the following lines:\n",
            "When there was nothing, there was God\n",
            "If nothing had been, God would have been\n",
            "My very being has been my downfall\n",
            "If I hadn\u2019t been, what would it have mattered?\n",
            "Various tones come across in the poem: negative and positive, and it might depend on the reader and his current condition. ",
            "Ghalib states that God has always been there for a human, and even if there is no hope and it seems that the world has ended, God will be there to help each soul. ",

            "The YouTube video published by GP Synergy, \u201cGP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services,\u201d sends a message that Aboriginal Medical Services play a crucial role within the diverse community. ",
            "The services are essential for providing culturally sensitive and high-quality care to the target populations, often marginalized and underserved, ensuring they have everything they need to tackle rising health concerns. ",
            "The comprehensive set of services provided by the medical facilities ensures that the patients from the Aboriginal community have access to affordable and convenient health care. ",
            "One service can support multiple aspects of clients\u2019 lives.\n",
            "The comprehensive approach toward culturally-sensitive care is especially relevant in addressing the social determinants of health (SHOD), which encompass multiple areas of the population\u2019s health, well-being, and quality of life. ",
            "SDOH includes safe housing, neighborhoods, convenient transportation, racial discrimination and violence, education, income, job opportunities, access to nutritional foods, low-quality air and water, and language and literacy skills (Healthy People 2030, 2020). ",
            "Therefore, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services aims to address the health disparities and inequities that most Aboriginal patients encounter (Pearson et al., 2020). ",
            "The professionals working within the Aboriginal Community Health Services framework underline the importance of patient education to ensure that the population is aware of its potential health challenges and knows about the necessity of early prevention and management.\n",
            "The prominent SHOD that is being discussed in the \u201cGP Training in Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services\u201d video is discrimination. ",
            "The health center workers acknowledge that many of their patients have experienced discrimination in the healthcare system and want to receive culturally-sensitive services (Kim, 2019). ",
            "Providing such services is challenging because healthcare workers do not know what to expect from each patient and must be prepared to carry out culturally sensitive services (Jongen, McCalman, and Bainbridge, 2018). ",
            "Care continuity is especially relevant in this case because when patients feel that they are being discriminated against or misunderstood, they are less likely to return to their providers to continue treatment or screening for their core health concerns.\n",
            "Even though implementing culturally sensitive care and addressing the SHOD of discrimination is challenging for providers, it is also highly rewarding. ",
            "The patients discriminated against want to feel accepted, understood, and cared for. ",
            "Because of this, the workers of the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services institutions always prioritize building meaningful relationships with their patients (Luft, 2017). ",
            "Besides, the professionals have noted that they have taken the role of advocates who support their patients in terms of healthcare services and their acceptance in their immediate community and the larger society.\n",
            "Therefore, the work of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services professionals entails consistent collaboration between themselves and their patients who feel underserved and misunderstood. ",
            "To conclude, addressing the social determinants of health that affects the Aboriginal community is a demanding process that requires dedication and focuses on the unique needs of patients coming to a facility to receive culturally-sensitive care. ",
            "Undoubtedly, the process will take some time because healthcare providers must be well-prepared and well-versed in the social determinants of health affecting their clients.\n",

            "The ancient historical texts on Minoans published by Halsall reflect some facts about their history discovered much later than these accounts had been compiled. ",
            "Namely, Plutarch\u2019s story about Theseus demonstrates the notion of the lack of defensive works in Crete. ",
            "According to this text, Theseus invaded the island\u2019s port and captured it quickly since its citizens mistook his navy for their own. ",
            "This detail could remind the truth: Minoans were merchants and did not develop extensive safeguards. ",
            "Moreover, Herodotos\u2019 text depicts the extinction of Cretans, which corresponds to the archeological data, although they mention the eruption as the main factor for the demise of Minoans.\n",
            "British Institute at Ankara\u2019s video about Helen of Troy is quite informative about the representation of women in ancient times. ",
            "As such, Helen was perceived as the most magnificent and feminine person for many centuries in Athens as well as Sparta. ",
            "Moreover, it is known that she became worshipped as a goddess in Laconia. ",
            "Greeks often depicted Helen via the use of the most precious materials, which signified the importance of this character. ",
            "This woman was traditionally perceived as a seducer and even the cause of sorrow in the Ancient Greek culture. ",
            "Moreover, the image of Helen of Troy has surpassed time and is still used as a euphemism of beauty.\n",
            "Evelyn-White\u2019s translation of Hesiod\u2019s Theogony presents valuable knowledge about the Greek religion. ",
            "Hesiod describes the gods as anthropomorphous beings who at the same time have natural power or represent parts of the universe themselves. ",
            "For example, the Earth and the Heaven are consorts that produce other gods, which are often associated with emotions or natural phenomena. ",
            "The story about Heaven (Uranus) being castrated by his rebellious child, Chronos, is especially remarkable. ",
            "The war of generations and overthrowing the elder by the younger is also present in Mesopotamian, Scandinavian, and other mythologies. ",
            "Hesiod\u2019s poem clarifies the Greek conception of gods: the primordial being and their offspring having unlimited powers in the world, and yet creatures with human emotions and motives.\n",
            "Women by Semonides of Amorgos, published by Temperance, depicts male Greeks\u2019 expectations for their women. ",
            "The author enumerates the types of women created by Zeus and primarily serve as an eternal punishment for mankind. ",
            "Semonides describes females that are not beautiful in a sarcastic manner, yet he condemns women who care about their appearance and hygiene. ",
            "Moreover, he complains about females that care about their household too much, as well as about ones who keep it not in the best ways; irritation expressed by wives also disappoints him. ",
            "A proper married woman, according to Semonides, should be like a bee: working with joy and caring for her family. ",
            "Furthermore, she should be a competent householder and not participate in raves with her girlfriends.\n",
            "Sappho\u2019s Hymn to Aphrodite is an exciting piece of poetry for several reasons. ",
            "First, it implies that the mortals and the gods can interact; people can pray for the help of the divinities and expect it to be fulfilled. ",
            "This notion suggests that gods can be both benevolent and cruel, and the fate of humans is always at their will. ",
            "Moreover, this poem indicates that Aphrodite is a goddess of love who interacts with human relationships by exercising her powers. ",
            "So, by begging Aphrodite to end the struggle and enter the fight, Sappho invokes the wreath of the goddess for a human being that has disappointed her love affairs.\n",

            "Grey Bull is a film that mirrors the social meaning of the bull to South Sudanese individuals. ",
            "Grey Bull , composed and coordinated by Eddie Bell, is a short film of around 15 minutes that reviews the antagonism between Martin, a South Sudanese man, and the owner of his cows\u2019 slaughterhouse.\n",
            "The foundations of Bell\u2019s story look back to the 1800s when one more novice to Australian shores was thinking of himself in the set of history books. ",
            "\u201cThe principal part of a thought was that I needed to make a cutting-edge Ned Kelly story,\u201d the video director uncovers in a discussion with Short of the Week.\n",
            "Grey Bull includes some strong creations, yet it is the strength of the story and the exhibitions that truly got many viewers\u2019 attention. ",
            "It is not difficult to see why director Bell won recognition for such a guaranteed film. ",
            "At the point when relocation is a hotly debated issue around the world, it\u2019s invigorating to be given a story circling a migrant that genuinely feels like it\u2019s introducing a good perspective on one such excursion.\n",
            "A tale about leaving your past behind so you can zero in on your future. ",
            "Grey Bull is a film that incites its crowd into taking on the perspective of its principal character and poses a few significant inquiries about displacement.\n",
            "The film has neither saints nor great intrigues, making it exclusively about a man character emergency. ",
            "However, in some way or another, the effortlessness of the visuals and nuance of the themes makes it agreeable to watch and adequately fascinating to rewatch once more. ",
            "The visuals are dazzling to move the more oversimplified case. ",
            "Every scene in this short film is without a hitch and intentionally shot with the viewer\u2019s goal generally well.\n",
            "Every shot is calculated and sufficiently bright, frequently emphasizing the perfect thing with impeccable timing, providing a way to picturesque guidance, where the video director will deliberately place spotlight and upgrade on a particular setting, article, subject, or conceptual point to pass on a message or feeling in the scene.\n",
            "The shading reviewed in the film is fresh, great, and satisfying to the eye; no blasts or channels are essential \u2013 each edge of this short movie is satisfying when watching. ",
            "Away from the camera works, Grey Bull has a surface to the entire job, a belief, and a mood that intensely influences the audience\u2019s feelings during the review.\n",
            "The climate or lighting assumes a severe part in each shot, frequently making the generally tranquil and tired film significantly more cloudy and toiling. ",
            "However, this does not jeopardize the movie; it makes the occurrence considerably more reasonable and exciting. ",
            "This is wholly built build-up by the strained and semi-off-kilter story of binding together and absorbing clashes with the living.\n",
            "The movie stays away from platitudes and tells a legitimate and consistent biography of a man loaded with inward struggle and compelled to pick either his previous or future life. ",
            "Grey Bull acts according to the usual short movie style: lay out the person, the contention, and the theme of the story, and let it work out so that it is straightforward. ",
            "It is convenient and compacts while also finishing with the typical closure of a short film being somehow or another enigmatic or open-finished.\n",
            "The initial 3/4ths of the film\u2019s length that relates to the primary and straightforward recounting of the story before the consummation is enthralling and somewhat relieving while as yet keeping the strained, abnormal feeling in the air that tends to be serene now and again. ",
            "However, explicit focuses break the harmony and contribute to a reestablished sensation of contention that gets the crowd\u2019s notice once more, all paving the way to a last unforeseen and shaking end.\n",
            "The end being, to some degree, enigmatic and open-finished makes for an excellent method for snagging the crowd into assessing the film. ",
            "This makes them theorize and surmise with regard to how and why the film had that particular closure \u2013 which is astute and makes for a movie that can be talked about for a very long time.\n",
            "Generally, the film gets a strong 9/10 making it flawed, as no film at any point truly is, yet it comes staggeringly near flawlessness. ",
            "Grey Bull is a film that can be watched by anybody regardless of the crowd, age, culture, or educational encounters. ",
            "I suggest everybody entirely watch the movie, process it, and provide it with a considerable measure of thought. ",
            "Grey Bull gives an exciting and novel story-driven experience that enraptures the personalities and feelings of its viewers while, at the same time, moving them nearer and further away to a compact completion, which permits them to process and think of their hypotheses that at last make the film simply that more intuitive.\n"

            "Gustave Moreau is a renowned Symbolist who invoked the motifs of ancient myths in his works. ",
            "An example of such a work is Jupiter and Semele , which he painted in 1985 in France (Smith par. ",
            "1). ",
            "The story expressed on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, afterward assimilated and revoked by Romans. ",
            "Namely, Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. ",
            "His angered wife, Juno, tricked Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his genuine appearance before her. ",
            "This wish was fulfilled, yet the divine nature of Jupiter\u2019s emanation was above the limits of what a human can perceive and suffer, so Semele died, and her child was cut out of her body. ",
            "Moreau\u2019s work depicts this tragic plot and indicates the theme of the difference between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the border of heaven and the underworld.\n",
            "The mentioned piece of art might seem somewhat baroque because of the excessive sumptuous details. ",
            "The central figure in the painting is giant Jupiter with luminous thunders haloed over his head. ",
            "He sits on a throne, enriched with Eastern-style figurines and jewel-like flora, and holds frightened Semele, who bleeds and looks like a marble statuette. ",
            "Above the god, giant columns penetrate the heaven; in the down part, various divinities and phantasmagoric creatures abide. ",
            "Nearby Jupiter\u2019s throne, Moreau placed an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the work. ",
            "Although there is a clear symmetric composition of the painting, its multiple elements make it difficult to discern the dominant images.\n",
            "Indeed, the central detail might be said to be Jupiter\u2019s enormous body and visage. ",
            "He wears countless ornaments and gems, as well as symbolic objects of various cultures: for example, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. ",
            "These artifacts might signify the despotic nature of the heavens\u2019 sovereign, similar to that of the Eastern rulers and Egyptian pharaohs. ",
            "Moreover, the stern and penetrating gaze, aimed at the viewer of the painting, demonstrates the resolute spirit of the god. ",
            "Hence, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is all-powerful and looming over humans.\n",
            "Next, Semele is highlighted by the whitish color of her skin and gown; she is also a dominating detail. ",
            "Her appearance contrast with that of Jupiter: she is almost nude, with only some cloth laying on her leg. ",
            "This image symbolized the nakedness of humans before the god, which is most likely Christian God, although Moreau uses symbols unrelated to Christianity. ",
            "The newborn Dionysus, who is dispatched from Semele already, as seen by the blood of her body, is often compared to Jesus. ",
            "Thus, Semele\u2019s direct interaction with god demonstrates the inability of humans to conceive the divine because of the immense differences between them.\n",
            "Furthermore, three figures attract the attention of the viewer: the two sitting women and a half-man near Jupiter. ",
            "From the left, the first female is Death holding a speared sword with blood on it and either covering her face from shame or removing tears with a piece of her dress (Smith). ",
            "Next to her, Pan with the hooved legs resides; he is another Greco-Roman divinity and a symbol of terror. ",
            "Finally, the woman in medieval clothes and with a thorn wreath over her head is Pain or Sorrow (Smith). ",
            "These characters illustrate the stable accompanying states of human living. ",
            "Thus, one more time, the mortality, suffering, and angst of people are contrasted with God\u2019s realm.\n",
            "Finally, it is necessary to outline the meaning of the depiction of the upper world and the lower domain. ",
            "The divine part, which surrounds Jupiter\u2019s throne, is embedded with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures appear in it. ",
            "In turn, the downside of the painting illustrates, for example, Hecate, who was a divine patron of witches and sorcerers. ",
            "The other winged or haloed divinities and creatures are also present. ",
            "This is probably the human world, full of evils and unknown threats. ",
            "This place and the heavens intersect with each other, indicating a connection between the divine and mortal.\n",
            "The other theme depicted in the work and connected to the contrast between human and divine might be rebirth. ",
            "Namely, the death of Semele followed by the birth of Dionysus is the symbol of the uninterrupted cycle of life. ",
            "Moreover, Dionysus is also considered a god, which means that although the differences between the two worlds are immense, they still have a connection and are interrelated. ",
            "Hence, whatever cruel and non-benevolent God might be, he is still present in the lives of people.\n",
            "To conclude, Gustave Moreau\u2019s Jupiter and Semele is a complex composition with a meaning that is not clearly defined. ",
            "However, this paper demonstrates that the dominant symbols and elements of the painting all play role in contrasting human and divine nature. ",
            "Thus, Moreau\u2019s presentation of the ancient myth has a completely new sense from the original plot, somewhat affected by Christianity, although depicted with Eastern aesthetics.\n",

            "In Hegemony and the language of contention , William Roseberry puts forth several crucial directions for comprehending hegemonic dynamics using Gramsci\u2019s Notebook section. ",
            "According to the last part of the entry, hegemony works in a specific way. ",
            "The character suggests that people utilize the idea to understand conflict rather than agreement. ",
            "Hegemony, therefore, establishes a common tangible and substantive foundation for living, criticizing, and responding to social arrangements marked by dominance. ",
            "The notion\u2019s significance for Gramsci in this specific moment, more specifically the collapse of northern-led Italian political development, is rooted in its illumination of vulnerability, of coalitions and class constituents unable to make their personal preferences be the interests of a larger community.\n",
            "My personal hegemonic experiences might include the observations of skyscrapers in the business centers of the cities. ",
            "Thousands of companies compete with each other for a fair share of the market. ",
            "As a result, among the ways to show their dominance and leadership is through their headquarters. ",
            "Skyscrapers are especially preferred by many, and the higher the building, the better. ",
            "Another example of hegemony can pertain to a modern political situation that involves one country trying to show dominance over others. ",
            "For example, while reading the news, I found out about the invasion of one country by a neighboring country.\n",
            "Hence, according to Roseberry and his narration, Gramsci grasped and stressed, more explicitly than his interpreters, the intricate interdependence of force and agreement in contexts of control. ",
            "In Gramsci\u2019s use, hegemony was a much more material and political notion than it seems to have become. ",
            "He recognized its instability, imperfection, dynamic aspects, and fluctuation. ",
            "Hegemony, therefore, refers to strength and leadership, though it remains a complex subject.\n"

            "\u201cYoung Goodman Brown\u201d was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1835, but it was set in Puritan New England during the late 17th century. ",
            "The Puritans split from England\u2019s Anglican Church, arriving at Plymouth Rock and founding both Plymouth and Boston. ",
            "They became the main Christian sect in New England at the period, though other Christian groups such as Quakers and Anabaptists also had significant populations. ",
            "Puritans believed in a rigid philosophy that left no space for mistake; for example, immoral thoughts and dreams were seen to be as damaging as actually committing a sin. ",
            "Native Americans who did not follow Christianity were likewise thought to be Satan\u2019s children, according to them. ",
            "\u201cYoung Goodman Brown\u201d is set during the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and exposes the Salem Puritans\u2019 hypocritical and inhibitive moral ideals.\n",
            "When Brown was discussing his impression of Goody Cloyse and his father, one example of how Hawthorne\u2019s heritage and Puritan beliefs were portrayed in the novel was shown. ",
            "In the anecdote, he expresses his surprise that Goody was out in the woods, especially at night. ",
            "\u201cA marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the wilderness at nightfall,\u201d Brown said (Hawthorne 3). ",
            "\u201cMy father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor his father before him. ",
            "We have been a race of honest men and good Christians since the days of the martyrs,\u201d Brown stated early in the story, referring to his father\u2019s honesty and Christian faith (Hawthorne 2). ",
            "Such an emphasis on religious faith could be understood through the reference to the Puritan beliefs.\n",
            "The Puritans\u2019 belief was that the devil was responsible for every evil deed that took place, whether it was through witchcraft or through rituals. ",
            "The Salem witch trials, which took place in the late 17th century and involved hearings, prosecutions, and executions, sentenced twenty people to death based on rumor and suspicion, including Martha Corey and Martha Ingalls Carrier, who is mentioned briefly in \u201cYoung Goodman Brown.\u201d John Hathorne, Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s direct ancestor, was one of the most ruthless judges in the Salem witch trials of 1692. ",
            "It\u2019s possible that Hawthorne felt some guilt about his ancestor\u2019s crimes; not only did he drop the \u201cw\u201d from his surname to disassociate himself from Hathorne, but he also spent most of his writing career delving into American Puritanism, often finding more criticism than praise.\n",
            "Despite the fact that the Salem Witch Trials had occurred more than a century before, nineteenth-century New England was still bleeding with inherited guilt, even as it revolted against the Puritans\u2019 restrictive standards. ",
            "Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts, into this culture in 1804. ",
            "His roots and sensibilities were undeniably Puritan, despite the fact that he designated Unitarian as his official religion. ",
            "The Salem Witch Trials, one of the terrifying incidents in Puritan history, saw the residents of Salem execute twenty-five innocent persons accused of being witches. ",
            "Accusations of witchcraft were frequently made for motives other than perceived witchcraft, such as retribution, jealousy, or botched child delivery. ",
            "During the second half of the seventeenth century, Quakers were subjected to Puritan intolerance. ",
            "Puritans and Quakers both came to America in search of religious liberty and the opportunity to establish their own colonies where they could believe whatever they wished.\n",

            "The coronavirus pandemic, which broke out all over the world for almost three years, completely changed the way of life of the modern world. ",
            "Many researchers, journalists, and writers cover this topic and talk about various situations that can sometimes lead to shock. ",
            "O\u2019Connor Meg wrote about one of these cases in the article \u201cMaricopa county moved homeless people to Sweltering parking lots in response to COVID-19\u201d. ",
            "This analysis aims to study this material in order to identify what actions were taken incorrectly and what consequences this entailed.\n",
            "People without permanent residence have become a particular threat to the spread of the pandemic. ",
            "This is because this group has nowhere to live, and they often have close contact with each other, do not follow hygiene rules, and have minimal access to medical care. ",
            "One of the opinions is that it is necessary to limit its causes with this problem. ",
            "In other words, it is necessary to increase the level of social assistance to the homeless, increasing the availability of housing and social benefits. ",
            "On the other hand, it is believed that homelessness and unemployment are psychological phenomena, and external factors cannot significantly contribute to their elimination. ",
            "Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation of the homeless have become particularly acute in the United States of America.\n",
            "The incident described in the article under study occurred in Maricopa County. ",
            "There, next to Arizona\u2019s biggest homeless shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) has been hosting tents with homeless people for a long time (O\u2019Conner para. ",
            "1). ",
            "As a measure to combat COVID-19, the state decided to relocate and encamp the camp near the encampment as part of Maricopa County\u2019s, which was now located in the open air. ",
            "Thus, hundreds of people were forced to change their habitat to a fenced asphalt place without shade in the triple-digit summer heat.\n",
            "As an example of a victim of homeless resettlement, there was the case of Elisha McKinley. ",
            "Even though the woman has almost found a place to live, she was moved to the camp a few months ago. ",
            "Moreover, McKinley faced police misconduct, as they threw away a cart that contained birth certificate, IDs and house-warming gifts from her daughter (O\u2019Conner para. ",
            "5). ",
            "In addition, although the government initially assessed these measures as temporary, permanent lamps were installed, from which people were expelled, preventing many of them from returning to the same place.\n",
            "All these measures were taken to contain the outbreak among the homeless part of the population, but the government managed to keep the situation under control. ",
            "In addition to the absurdity of bringing people out into the open under the scorching sun, this decision was met with great doubt both from society and the state authorities. ",
            "This factor became stronger after it became known about the death of three people in the fenced parking lot.\n",
            "Moreover, despite the negative in the direction of moving homeless people to the parking lot, social services request to change the zoning permit, that is, to increase it. ",
            "This decision should attract a more significant number of people without a home. ",
            "However, like the initial measure to move the camp, this initiative was met with a counter-action. ",
            "In this case, businesses and homeowners in the neighborhood are dissatisfied with it. ",
            "Such an attitude can significantly slow down the expansion process, as the services will have to wait for the city council\u2019s approval. ",
            "Based on the hostile experience of implementing the initiative concerning homeless camps, the Phoenix government is taking new measures. ",
            "Hence, Phoenix raised money to rent one hundred and fifty hotel rooms for homeless residents, but this is only a tiny fraction of the entire infected homeless population.\n",
            "Therefore, this work carried out an analysis of the article about the not entirely fictitious actions of the right of Phoenix. ",
            "The authorities, in the fight against a new coronavirus infection, moved homeless people to a fenced parking lot in the heat. ",
            "This action led to the death of several people, which led to a wave of discontent from the general public. ",
            "Because the pandemic is still not defeated, many people are losing their jobs and applying for unemployment benefits. ",
            "Therefore, service providers and the state government need to work out measures to solve the potential problem. ",

            "And it is said there about this in a prohibitive manner: \u201cDo not lie down with a man as with a woman: this is an abomination.\u201d (Leviticus 18:22) The Apostle Paul says the following: \u201cJust as men, having rejected natural intercourse with women, burn with lust for one another: men do shameful deeds with men, preparing for themselves the retribution that they deserve, having gone astray.\u201d (Rom 1:27) First of all, when talking about homosexuality \u2013 the scriptures talk about \u201cintercourse\u201d or \u201clust,\u201d but not about orientation in the sense that homosexual people today have in mind \u2013 an equal love relationship between two partners of the same sex.

            "The introduction of computer technologies in modern society involves many activities that seemingly do not have a connection with computer technologies themselves, such as the recruiting process. ",
            "With the rise of corporate culture and the development of a more competitive market of candidates, a detailed candidate selection process required a more straightforward solution than manual filtering. ",
            "Recently, after assessing the possibilities of wide application of newly developed AI technologies, Human Resource managers started using program software to reduce the workload associated with the selection process. ",
            "The article by Pardes explores how the candidates learned to manipulate the technology in favor of their own interests.\n",
            "The article starts with an interview with the person who discovered the consistent patterns in the operation of the software\u2019s candidate selection system, Shirin Nilizadeh. ",
            "According to Pardes, a friend approached Nilizadeh with concerns about her resume. ",
            "Alizadeh\u2019s friend has come to the conclusion that her resumes do not reach HR managers as they inexplicably seem to lack something. ",
            "Through a series of enhancements to a collection of random resumes, Nilizadeh defined that using certain words not necessarily associated with required qualifications can increase the candidates\u2019 position in the resume-ranking program. ",
            "While Nilizadeh\u2019s interest was related to academic purposes, many platforms offer the candidates a chance to improve their resume with all kinds of hacks, such as inserting relevant keywords in invisible font. ",
            "It turns out that there are many ways for the candidates to increase their chances of to interview, from including the names of prestigious universities to using competitor company names and copying the job description details.\n",
            "Further in the article, the author explains that focusing on efficiency can result in over-dignifying technology. ",
            "One of the interviewees in the article, Joseph Fuller, suggests that excessive use of artificial intelligence in the recruiting process can create \u201ca high-tech pathway to discrimination\u201d (qtd. ",
            "in Pardes). ",
            "Therefore, without knowing the necessary keywords or using the different formulations for the existing skills, a substantial portion of job applicants may never proceed to the next stage of the selection process. ",
            "According to Julie Schweber\u2019s perspective featured in Pardes\u2019 article, software filters as many as 75% of applicants based on the resume meeting the specific job criteria. ",
            "The issue is worsened by the fact that third parties offer paid resume enhancement and applicant tracking systems, influencing the labor market competitiveness level by improving the situation for applicants with financial means.\n",
            "Analyzing the information acquired from the article emphasizes the impersonal character of technology. ",
            "While using technology to optimize organizational processes can benefit productivity, it creates a barrier for individuals with insufficient technological skills. ",
            "In addition, excessive reliance on technology results in the presence of process weaknesses that can be manipulated for malicious or harmful purposes. ",
            "Therefore, while the use of technology seemingly increases objectivity in the decision-making process, the potential manipulations can equal the outcomes of nepotism, corruption, and bribery.\n",
            "Lastly, I decided to choose this article because it displays the weaknesses of technological systems and their improper application in modern society. ",
            "It was interesting to learn about the influence of the nuances between human and machine perceptions in reading the text typed in white color on white paper. ",

            "Epithelial tissues of the body represent the tissues lining the surfaces of skin, digestive organs, and respiratory organs. ",
            "They can be found anywhere in the body where a barrier is needed to be formed, with things being able to pass across the created barrier. ",
            "Because of the wide coverage of epithelial tissues in the body, there are many types of diseases affecting the tissue, and it is essential to know them to understand how the disease affects epithelial tissues. ",
            "At this time, let\u2019s focus on eczema as one of the widespread concerns of epithelial tissue.\n",
            "Put simply, eczema also referred to as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that affects the skin, which is made of epithelial tissue1. ",
            "It makes the skin red and itchy and can first manifest in people as early as childhood. ",
            "It is important to note that eczema tends to transform into a chronic condition for many people and can disappear and flare up periodically, often depending on environmental factors. ",
            "Unfortunately, there is no cure that can help clear eczema entirely and make it never reappear. ",
            "Although, there are several treatments and self-care activities that can help relieve the itching and redness and prevent new flare-ups on a short-term basis. ",
            "Examples of good practices for eczema include avoiding harsh soaps, moisturizing the skin on a regular basis, as well as applying medicated creams and different types of ointments.\n",
            "Getting to know the symptoms of atopic dermatitis can help identify the signs early to engage in preventive and management efforts, according to a doctor\u2019s recommendations. ",
            "While the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis can vary from one person to another, they typically include dry skin, itching of different extents, especially during the night, the appearance of red to darker-colored patches, usually on the hands, feet, neck, ankles, wrists, as well as inside the knees and elbows\u2019 bends. ",
            "The skin affected by eczema usually appears thickened, scaly, and cracked, and due to scratching, it can often be raw, swollen, and highly sensitive to different external factors. ",
            "Also, one may check for signs of small bumps that can leak fluid and crust over when being scratched.\n",
            "When it comes to the age differentiation of eczema, the onset of the disease is often at five years old, with the highest incidence taking place between three and six months, but it can take place at any age. ",
            "Around 60% of patients develop eczema in the first year of their life, while 90% get it within the first five years1. ",
            "However, it is notable that atopic dermatitis can happen to people of different ages, although the percentage is much lower than those mentioned for children.\n",
            "The burden of disease can be different depending on its severity as well as the ways of management. ",
            "However, pain and itchiness of the skin can be quite cumbersome, preventing a person affected by eczema from doing everyday things2. ",
            "Also, because eczema can often have an unpleasant appearance, some people can be self-conscious about it and get embarrassed, which is quite unfortunate3. ",
            "Therefore, the problem with eczema is that it can significantly reduce the quality of life and health. ",

            "Human Dignity in Philosophy and Bioethics Essay\n",
            "According to Kant\u2019s philosophy, the distinction between a person and a thing runs through several basic criteria, largely related to independence and dignity. ",
            "A thing is only a means to finitude, that is, to any completion, while man contains completion in himself. ",
            "Man differs in his finitude from the infinity of the world, but he is valuable in himself and cannot be used as a means. ",
            "This determines autonomy, that is, the independence of a person. ",
            "Implicit autonomy determines the inner ability of a person to do anything and, accordingly, the ability to distinguish between good and evil. ",
            "According to Kant, a person, in contrast to a thing, has a moral navigator that is common to everyone. ",
            "It is because of the opportunity to master the concepts of good and evil and use them morally a person differs from a thing. ",
            "A person cannot be used as a means and therefore, unlike a thing, has no value.\n",
            "Dignity should be perceived as an innate and inalienable trait of any person, regardless of social institutions, class, and experience. ",
            "At the same time, dignity is not only an internal concept since it is something that can be given by one person to another, such as respect or favor. ",
            "This means that the concept of human dignity may not always be strictly intrinsic. ",
            "Concepts about the transfer or innateness of dignity can have a significant impact on medical practice. ",
            "A doctor who believes that it is they who give dignity to other people by paying attention to them runs the risk of falling into misconceptions that distort moral representations. ",
            "At the same time, a physician who professes equal human dignity and believes it is intrinsic is able to respect the patient\u2019s autonomy. ",
            "However, this, in turn, can create treatment dilemmas if patient autonomy conflicts with the specialist\u2019s professionalism. ",
            "In any case, a medical worker who professes human dignity as an inalienable value follows key principles of bioethics such as autonomy and justice more closely.\n",
            "By the uselessness of dignity in medical practice, McLean means that talking about criteria for dignity in bioethics only distracts from the primary immediate goal of treatment. ",
            "Somerville argues in her book that when dialogue in bioethics comes to a general agreement, the term dignity seems useful and relevant. ",
            "If it is impossible to agree, the concept of dignity is depreciated and becomes useless. ",
            "However, the idea of dignity can vary and be distorted in such a way that the very dignity of a person will be humiliated; there will be no dignity in a person. ",
            "There is a constructionist approach to human perception, in which the personality must meet the criteria to be considered truly human. ",
            "This is the third use case for this concept, in which the misuse of this view becomes really dangerous.\n",
            "A person can be determined by a higher awareness and cognitive ability, which determines the knowledge of their goal on Earth and moral criterion. ",
            "However, some people with mental disabilities may thus actually not fit the criteria for being human. ",
            "Consequently, their external dignity will be diminished by those who believe that their internal dignity is worthless. ",
            "This is a terrible mistake in moral judgment and is very dangerous for medical ethics. ",
            "Moreover, the question of human dignity arises in the case of embryos and embryos, which significantly complicates the issue of moral responsibility and giving dignity to a person in the case of an abortion procedure. ",
            "Thus, the external dignity of a person comes from the field of social experience and the attitude of other people to a person, which is most valuable in bioethics and medical practice. ",
            "The pursuit of dignity in each person can help a doctor make truly valuable ethical decisions and can help other professionals make them.\n"

            "in Mexicans in the Making of America. ",
            "The author gave his view of these events in the first chapter, \u201cThe Genesis of Mexican America,\u201d where he presented the history of the appearance of Mexican Americans and the silent conflict between the two countries. ",
            "The author\u2019s central claim is that the American government created an image of lazy Mexican immigrants who cross the border to murder and sell illicit drugs; this stigmatization affected Mexican Americans, too (Foley 34). ",
            "However, the truth was that white settlers from the southern states were illegal invaders in Texas in the 1830s because they refused to obey the country\u2019s laws (Imery-Garcia 12). ",
            "Discrimination against Mexican immigrants and citizens was rooted in the 1846-1848 war and the treaty\u2019s approval, which included Texas and Mexican people living there into the U.S. ",
            "territory and being denied their rights.\n",
            "It was interesting to learn from this chapter the viewpoint of many people in the United States about Mexico as a country of cruel and uneducated people. ",
            "Indeed, it points to the erased memory of the Aztec Empire, the abolition of slavery in Mexico much earlier than in the U.S., and the annexation of Texas. ",
            "The 1846-1848 war between the two countries was an unfair, violent act of the U.S. ",
            "government towards a weaker neighbor, which suffered economic downfall at that time (Foley 24). ",
            "The new legislation after the war gave people the choice of returning to Mexico or becoming U.S. ",
            "citizens with formally equal rights that were not respected in reality (Guti\u00e9rrez 5). ",
            "Therefore, most of them wanted to be viewed as Spanish Americans rather than people of Mexican descent to avoid stigmatization. ",
            "I agree with the author\u2019s final point that this historical event created not only a political border between two neighbors but caused subsequent misunderstandings in the relationships between the two nations.\n",
            "In summary, the first chapter in Foley\u2019s Mexicans in the Making of America talks about the origin of Mexican Americans. ",
            "Specifically, it analyzed the role of the war between Mexico and the U.S. ",
            "for Texas\u2019s territory in the future political climate between these countries. ",

            "The proposed reconsideration was associated with numerous challenges linked to the nature of new technology and staff experiences and skills. ",
            "For instance, nurses training to acquire knowledge of how to use new approaches was complicated by the lack of time and the absence of experience. ",
            "Also, nursing assistants were unfamiliar with paperwork and documents, which was an additional limitation. ",
            "However, it is possible to admit the positive nature of the outlined change and its possibility to promote positive outcomes. ",
            "Several reasons from the case can help to prove this statement.\n",
            "First of all, the change can be analyzed using Lewin\u2019s model, implying three major phases. ",
            "These are unfreezing, change, and refreezing typical for all processes. ",

            "Moreover, the benefits of integrating the EPR and ECP were outlined, contributing to the growing interest and motivation to participate in the process. ",
            "It means that the successful unfreezing phase was one of the success factors influencing the change process in the selected hospital.\n",
            "Another positive aspect of change was the staff\u2019s engagement and readiness to overcome difficulties. ",
            "Thus, the integration of new technologies was viewed as something inevitable, which helped to establish a positive attitude toward the scope of change. ",
            "Additionally, regardless of some problems discovered during the reconsideration of the unit\u2019s work, the staff remained optimistic about outcomes and the possibility of achieving the current goals. ",
            "It means that the organizational culture, values, and philosophy were considered and employed to create the basis for change and support it. ",
            "At the same time, the case shows that project members and workers supported each other during the most critical moments and were ready to do extra work to ensure the change continues and there are no critical barriers influencing outcomes.\n",
            "Finally, the role of leadership should also be admitted as managers create the basis for change. ",
            "It was achieved due to the close cooperation with team members and a clear outline of goals along with their benefits. ",

            "Additionally, the article provides information about the upcoming prosecution concerning the statements of the TV host.\n",
            "First of all, it is necessary to evaluate the article in terms of codes of ethics considering ethical news values. ",
            "In terms of accuracy, the material presents facts, and the author does not present his personal opinion on the issue, which makes the article the most devoid of bias. ",
            "Most importantly, El-Sayed quotes statements from the TV host and various stakeholders without commentary, which eliminates subjectivity. ",
            "In terms of confirmation and tenacity, the reporter gives not only statements but also opinions of the community, presents the prospect of prosecution, and also gives background information about Eissa. ",
            "These factors allow the reader to compose a more comprehensive perception of the event beyond the immediate news.\n",
            "The author also respects diversity, citing the opinions of both official bodies and religious communities for whom this event is important. ",
            "In terms of dignity and reciprocity, The reporter uses non-emotionally colored vocabulary, which corresponds to the journalistic style. ",
            "Additionally, El-Sayed tries to provide as much information as possible about the event and the reaction that it caused in the community. ",
            "This factor also corresponds to the value of community, as it reveals the possible impact of Eissa\u2019s statements on society.\n",
            "However, concerning equity, the article does not seem complete enough, as it focuses more on the reaction to this event. ",
            "Within the framework of the information provided, it is not entirely clear whether there are supporters of the statements of the TV host or whether the community as a whole reacted negatively to his statements. ",
            "Accordingly, in this regard, the value of sufficiency is also inadequately addressed since not all information resources are covered.\n",
            "Based on the analysis of codes of ethics, one can also conclude the objectivity and credibility of this material. ",
            "Objectivity prescribes that all parties affected by the event have an equal right to be covered in the article. ",
            "However, within the framework of the article by El-Sayed, not enough attention is paid to the opinion of Eissa himself, as well as his possible supporters. ",
            "This factor can make the article biased, and additional information about the past actions of the TV host can create a negative perception of the protagonist of the story among readers. ",
            "In terms of credibility, the article meets the requirements of journalistic standards, as it provides information resources and quotes, and does not refer to abstract assumptions.\n",
            "A coherent theory of truth can be applied to this news report as the information presented in it is consistent with other beliefs. ",
            "El-Sayed celebrates the opinions of the religious community, revealing the common opinion on the event, which makes it acceptable within society. ",
            "It is necessary to keep in mind that the covered event in the article refers to religious beliefs that are extremely significant for the major part of Egyptian society. ",
            "This material, therefore, can be considered from the point of view of utilitarianism, which involves reporting events with the goal of the least harm to the largest population. ",
            "In this situation, the lack of information from possible supporters of the TV host may be a desire to satisfy the interests of the majority of society and not offend their feelings.\n",

            "Lady Mary\n",
            "Lady Mary Wroth was a member of a distinguished literary family during the Renaissance. ",
            "She was the niece of Mary Herbert, an eminent writer and patron during the 16th century. ",
            "Mary married Robert Roth, but their marriage was unhappy. ",
            "In the meantime, Lady Mary began to vent her grief with the help of poetry. ",
            "Thus, her sonnet In this strange labyrinth represents the author\u2019s throwing about the mysteries that love keeps. ",
            "The significance of Lady Mary for literature is that she was the first female poet in England to write a complete sequence of sonnets called from Pamphilia to Amphilanthus.\n",
            "\u201cIn this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides\u201d\n",
            "The image of one who is lost in the labyrinth of love and is desperately looking for a way out is common in the sonnets of the Renaissance. ",
            "In many gardens at this time there were labyrinths that played the role of an entertainment event. ",
            "Thus, the very name of the sonnet personifies the labyrinth in which every lover rushes about. ",
            "The lyrical hero describes the difficult situation in which he found himself with the help of the words \u201cIn this strange Labyrinth how shall I turn/Ways are on all sides\u201d (Wroth). ",
            "Different paths diverge in all directions, but none of them seems right.\n",
            "The origins of the labyrinth referred to in the poem find their origin in the myth of Theseus. ",
            "The hero was saved by a woman named Ariadne, who gave him a golden thread so that Theseus could find a way out of the labyrinth of the Minotaur.\n",
            "\u201cLeave all, and take the thread of Love\u201d\n",
            "However, Lady Mary in the sonnet uses a labyrinth to create a metaphor for suffocation, which crushes her own desires, forcing a woman to be silent and do housework during the Renaissance. ",
            "The symbol of modern conventions of that era are destroying her and do not allow her to live a full life.\n",
            "The heroine does not have the right to tell Amphilanthus about her love, however, she is unable to avoid her feelings and vows to \u2018leave all, and take the thread of Love\u2019 (Wroth). ",
            "This thread symbolizes divine love for Christ. ",
            "It allows her to find the only way back, but the thread is too thin and the heroine can easily go astray. ",
            "Thus, the labyrinth is not only a symbol of loss, but also a trap in which a person finds himself because of his feelings.\n",
            "The way, the truth, and the light\n",
            "In addition, there is a religious allusion in the sonnet. ",
            "In the New Testament, Jesus indicates that he is the way, the truth, and the light. ",
            "Thus, the lyrical hero\u2019s anger is due to the fact that the speaker is faced with many ways representing love. ",
            "However, these are all personifications of one person\u2019s romantic love for another, and none of them are \u201cthe way\u201d, which means the love of Christ.\n",
            "Finally, the heroine makes her decision in the third stanza. ",
            "She understands that it seems impossible for her to choose one path that she will take and she chooses all paths. ",
            "Thus, the heroine asks \u201clet me take the right, or left hand way\u201d. ",
            "She tolerates her insecurities and moves on by enduring suffering. ",
            "However, at the end, the focus shifts and the heroine realizes that she wants to leave the labyrinth. ",
            "Thus, she wants to follow the thread of love, no matter how this road ends.\n",

            "The issue of tribal sovereignty has been scrutinized over the years, the treatment of tribes ranging from supportive measures and attempts of integration into the broader community to outright persecution. ",
            "In this connection, the law about tribal gaming can be seen as a positive step towards recognition of tribes\u2019 unique way of life and self-determination. ",
            "This essay discusses the question \u201chow tribal gaming act can add to the sovereignty of tribes?\u201d\n",
            "Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes were given the right to determine what gaming activities they wanted to engage in, and in most cases, the permission was granted by the state. ",
            "Gaming activities could embrace tribal rituals or games of chance, depending on the wishes of the tribes and had to be agreed to by the state (Light and Rand). ",
            "Since often tribal games are unique and have a deep meaning for the tribe, it would be right to say that granting tribes the right to hold their own games is necessary. ",
            "This measure helps to uphold their culture and establish sovereignty over a very important sphere of life, which is relaxation. ",
            "Moreover, gaming helps to support traditions and customs through rituals that have been molded over the centuries.\n",
            "As far as sovereignty is concerned, gaming serves to establish the spheres of life which are completely under the tribes\u2019 jurisdiction. ",
            "Thus, for example, some tribe members mix with the society at large, finding employment or integrating themselves in the life of big cities. ",
            "However, gaming, and in particular traditional tribal gaming, serves as a reminder of one\u2019s roots, promotes freedom of choice and sovereignty as it is the one thing that is almost completely under the tribes\u2019 jurisdiction.\n",

            "Individual freedoms and national security are sometimes seen as two opposites. ",
            "However, in ideal, national security should reflect the balanced relationship between the two mentioned concepts. ",
            "Moreover, the principle of the prevalence of individual freedoms over the national security underlies the democratic idea. ",

            "This essay proposes that the protection of individual freedoms by maintaining national security is a fundamental principle and goal of democracy. ",
            "US President Joe Biden notes, \u201cI strongly believe that democracy is the key to freedom, prosperity, peace, and dignity\u201d (Biden 3). ",
            "Unlike authoritarian or totalitarian systems, a democratic system puts individual freedoms ahead of national security interests. ",
            "The implementation of this principle always raises controversy, since there is no single rule universal for all cases. ",
            "However, individual freedoms are protected in most areas of social life, including migration, cyber security, economic stability, and international diplomatic relations. ",
            "Interestingly, actual cyber security policy and practice take both human-centric and national-security-centric approaches (Deibert 411). ",

            "The above example indicates the breadth of possibilities for applying the principle.\n",
            "There is probably a counter-argument against the opinion that national security interests should take precedence over individual freedoms. ",
            "This position can be justified by an external threat or military ambitions and is usually applied by authoritarian regimes. ",
            "This position is wrong since national security should protect the interest of every citizen, not the abstract idea of the nation. ",
            "Every citizen is part of the nation and their freedoms should be sacred.\n",
            "Thus, it was discussed, how individual freedoms should never be sacrificed in the name of national security. ",

            "The other two important events are church baptism activities and wrestling matches among male children between 10 to 17 years. ",
            "Among the six subjects, I am not familiar with inter families football competitions, but I find it to be the most exciting event.\n",

            "The competition only involves youths from the age of 18 to 30 years. ",
            "One of the leaders elaborated that this program is purely for the youths who are seeking self-discovery. ",
            "These competitions are held during the school holidays between December and January.\n",
            "Regarding this interesting and important event, I had already known a few things. ",
            "I know that this competition program is sponsored by The Association for Talent Development. ",
            "Again, this program creates employment for young people; three of my cousins are currently working with the American Federation of Women. ",
            "Conversely, one thing I may want to know is how the pandemic affected event\u2019s plans and challenges they have faced during the pandemic.\n",
            "Talent identification and employment creation make this event interesting since it helps fight joblessness among the youths. ",
            "In an interview with Mr. ",
            "Bowers, the chairman of the great community event, Mr. ",
            "Bowers explained that the COVID-19 pandemic policies implementation by the state interrupted the event plans. ",
            "These COVID-19 pandemic policies included lockdown and curfews and social distancing. ",
            "Lockdown prevented the events, financiers, and sponsors from attending football training, while curfew reduced football training hours. ",
            "On the other hand, social distance did not allow the full football teams to practice, thus reducing the effectiveness of those teams. ",
            "Apart from financial challenges, Mr. ",
            "Bowers also mentioned that they lack spacious fields to accommodate all players concerning the social distancing COVID-19 policy by the state.\n",
            "According to my own research, I found out that COVID-19 indeed disrupted the event activities and plans. ",
            "On watching the current videos played by Mr. ",
            "Bowers in his office, it was evident that instead of 14 players, the field could only accommodate eight players. ",
            "In comparing the previous and current football training sessions, there was a difference in audience volume. ",
            "And this had a negative impact on supporting talent and employment creation since the audience included the event sponsors who could not attend the event to identify the talented individuals (D\u00f6nmez et al. ",

            "The recorded football match in 2019 backward was much better than of 2020 and 2021. ",
            "During these two years, the players did not have enough space and time to train as a full team, thus leading to poor performance. ",
            "The poor performance due to insufficient training has also led to the sponsor\u2019s reluctance towards supporting the event.\n",
            "Based on my analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the inter families football competition, the most important and interesting event in my community. ",
            "This event has been interesting since it showcases amazing football talent among the youth and is important because it creates employment for the youths. ",
            "From my observation of the previous and currently recorded videos, COVID-19 policies by the state have killed the event. ",
            "Social distance has impeded the entire team from training together; the lockdown has prevented the sponsors from flying to physically watch and identify talents, while curfew has limited the training hours (D\u00f6nmez et al. ",

            "Net Present Value (NPV) reflects the amount of cash an investor or funder expects to receive from a project after inflows are recouped through all sorts of costs. ",
            "This figure can be understood as the investor\u2019s total profit generated once the payback begins. ",
            "NPV gives a clear indication of whether a project is worth investing in based on likely costs and potential risk. ",
            "NVP has many more advantages over other investment criteria.\n",
            "The rules that apply to NVP include common sense and the reasonableness of the investment and take into account return criteria. ",
            "Since the calculation of NVP involves a time horizon, it is already profitable over static measures. ",
            "Accordingly, the first advantage of NVP is its connection to the idea of an expected value, which will be less than at the time of investment. ",
            "Unlike the payback period, NVP recognizes that the value of a currency is temporary and subject to change, so it lays this metric into the calculation of discount rates. ",
            "Assumptions about the cost of capital allow the NVP to be calculated and suggest a strategy for profitable ways to implement the project. ",
            "Consequently, the second advantage of this criterion is flexibility and additivity, that is, understanding the benefits of all available projects or one specific one. ",
            "A third advantage may be that the calculation of NVP considers the size of the investment. ",
            "This means that NVP is a unidimensional criterion that allows us to estimate the degree of probability of wealth creation based on the number of cash flows.\n",
            "Thus, NVP has several advantages over other investment criteria based on its application. ",
            "First, NVP considers the present value of money, which gives a clear picture of cash transactions. ",
            "Second, it is flexible and additive, meaning it evaluates the cost of capital and the appropriateness of the investment. ",
            "Third, NVP is a one-dimensional indicator that considers all, even space investments.\n"

            "Considerable musicians have represented soul music, and James Brown was one of the most prominent. ",
            "Southern soul became extremely popular towards the end of the 1960s, and Brown had his first success in 1956 (Covach and Flory 218). ",
            "Initially, Brown worked as a stand-in for Little Richard, and his first record, \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d was quite thriving (Covach and Flory 240-241). ",
            "Brown used to sing lead vocals, and his early musical style resembled that of the 1950s doo-wop (Covach and Flory 242). ",
            "However, he began to develop the soul style in 1960 with \u201cThink,\u201d characterized by horns and a driving rhythm section (Covach and Flory 242). ",
            "In 1964, Brown introduced \u201cOut of Sight,\u201d which represented the hard-driving soul style featured in his later songs towards the 1970s (Covach and Flory 242). ",
            "James Brown was one of the performers who took control of their music, as he united an aggressive style of vocal and dance performance, production skills, and understanding of business (Covach and Flory 242). ",
            "Brown\u2019s musical style through the 1960s and into the 1970s changed from following prior era\u2019s themes to creating his unique sounds.\n",
            "As Brown was searching for and evolving his individual style, his career differed from Motown, Stax, or Atlantic artists and led him to produce distinguishable songs. ",
            "For instance, the stops at the end of the verses in Brown\u2019s \u201cPapa\u2019s Got a Brand New Bag, Pt. ",

            "At the same time, the absence of background vocals in the song varies from Motown\u2019s approach (Covach and Flory 243). ",
            "Moreover, James Brown\u2019s music was highly famous within the Black community, as, unlike Motown and Atlantic artists, Brown expressed apparent racial pride through hard-edged musical style and political lyrics (Covach and Flory 244). ",
            "Brown acted passionately on his live shows as a singer, dancer, and bandleader but also hired notable musicians and rehearsed them tirelessly (Covach and Flory 240). ",

            "Janina\u2019s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. ",

            "While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina\u2019s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. ",
            "She states, \u201cI believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.\u201d She considers names \u201cpolyonymous\u201d and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters.\n",

            "She denies other pet names, saying that \u201cconsidering her personal history\u201d they could not be suitable for the dog. ",

            "Honestly, the interior of the dumpster does not look that bad, and the best thing is that Wilson is able to lay there comfortably. ",
            "Therefore, personally, living in a dumpster is an option for times when I feel like I need to be alone. ",
            "But lack of commodities associated with the home kitchen and bathroom is why I could not choose the dumpster as a place of my permanent residence.\n"

            "There are several ways to compare and contrast the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. ",
            "Socially, the two civilizations were very different; the Greeks were known for their strong sense of democracy, while the Mesopotamians were ruled by kings and queens. ",
            "Politically, there were also major differences; the Greeks were republics, while the Mesopotamians had empires. ",
            "Economically, Ancient Greece was known for its many exports, while Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural society. ",
            "Culturally, the two civilizations differed in terms of their writing systems and religions. ",
            "The Greeks used an alphabet that is still in use today, while the Mesopotamians developed a cuneiform script. ",
            "Therefore, there are eminently social, political, economic, and cultural differences and similarities between Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek.\n",
            "The social differences between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were vast. ",
            "Mesopotamia was a very hierarchical society, with a strict caste system in place. ",
            "There was very little opportunity for social mobility, and the powerful ruled over the masses with an iron fist. ",
            "Ancient Greece, on the other hand, was much more egalitarian. ",
            "People were able to move up in status if they were talented or ambitious, and democracy was practiced in many city-states (Adams 35). ",
            "This resulted in a much more prosperous society overall. ",
            "Similarly, Ancient Greece was a much more democratic society than Mesopotamia. ",
            "In Athens, for example, all male citizens had the right to vote and participate in government. ",
            "Wealthy citizens could not buy their way into office; they had to be elected by their peers. ",
            "Mesopotamian society was much more stratified; at the top were the rulers and priests, followed by a small number of wealthy landowners (Adams 43). ",
            "The vast majority of people were slaves or peasants who worked the land. ",
            "There was no concept of democracy in Mesopotamia; instead, society was ruled by a small elite group who claimed divine authority.\n",
            "Both Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations exhibited a great deal of social similarity. ",
            "For example, both were patriarchal societies in which women had few rights and were largely confined to the home. ",
            "In addition, both societies placed a high value on warfare and physical prowess and considered martial prowess to be one of the key markers of manhood. ",
            "There were also some key differences between these two civilizations. ",
            "One major difference was that the Ancient Greeks were far more egalitarian than the Mesopotamians (Frahm 119). ",
            "This is evidenced by the fact that in Ancient Greece, women could own property, engage in business, and even participate in politics. ",
            "Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in terms of their social structures. ",
            "Both were based on hierarchies in which people were divided into classes according to their wealth, power, and status. ",
            "However, the two civilizations differed in terms of their religious beliefs. ",
            "The Mesopotamians believed in a pantheon of gods, while the Ancient Greeks believed in a single god who governed the world.\n",
            "The two civilizations differed in their political structures; Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Greece was a democracy. ",
            "Mesopotamia\u2019s theocracy meant that the gods were responsible for guiding the human king in carrying out his responsibilities. ",
            "In contrast, Greek democracy placed ultimate power in the hands of all free male citizens (Frahm 117). ",
            "This resulted in decisions being made through discourse and voting, as opposed to divine guidance. ",
            "The two civilizations differed in their political structures. ",
            "Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Ancient Greece was a republic. ",
            "In Mesopotamia, the king was considered to be the representative of the gods on Earth. ",
            "He had absolute power and controlled all aspects of society (Frahm 111). ",
            "In Ancient Greece, by contrast, citizens had the right to vote and to participate in government. ",
            "There were also many different city-states, each with its laws and customs. ",
            "This allowed for a great deal of diversity and debate.\n",
            "Similarly, both cultures were polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled all aspects of human life. ",
            "They also shared similar architectural styles, with temples and palaces constructed similarly. ",
            "The most significant similarity between these two cultures is their approach to warfare (Adams 55). ",
            "Both Mesopotamians and Ancient Greeks believed that a victorious battle could bring great rewards, not only for the victors but for the entire city or nation. ",
            "This led to highly strategic wars fought by armies of brave soldiers who valued their honor above all else.\n",
            "Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were outstandingly similar in their political structures. ",
            "Both were considered city-states, and each city was ruled by a king who had complete authority within his domain (Frahm 121). ",
            "Citizens of the city were required to obey the king\u2019s decrees, and disputes between cities were often resolved through warfare. ",
            "The major difference between these two civilizations was in their religious beliefs. ",
            "The Mesopotamians believed in many gods, while the Ancient Greeks only believed in one god, Zeus. ",
            "This difference led to different attitudes towards warfare \u2013 the Mesopotamians fought for religious reasons, while the Ancient Greeks fought for political reasons (to expand or protect their territory). ",
            "The two civilizations had some political similarities in that they were both led by powerful kings, and their economies were based largely on agriculture (Frahm 115). ",
            "However, the Mesopotamian civilization was considerably more advanced than the Ancient Greek civilization. ",
            "For example, the Mesopotamians developed writing, while the Ancient Greeks did not. ",
            "Additionally, the Mesopotamians had a more complex system of government, with a large number of social classes and a complex legal system.\n",
            "The main economic difference between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations was that the Mesopotamians were a more mercantile society while the Ancient Greeks were more focused on agriculture. ",
            "The Mesopotamians were merchants who traded goods such as textiles, spices, and metals. ",
            "They built their economy on the principle of credit and debt, which led to a high level of commercial activity. ",
            "The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were farmers who grew their food (Heriyanto 95). ",
            "They did not have as strong a trading economy and instead focused on developing their political and artistic cultures. ",
            "The ancient Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations were two of the most influential in history.\n",
            "Though they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. ",
            "Mesopotamia was an early example of a centrally planned economy. ",
            "Central planners decided what goods would be produced, how much of each good would be produced, and what prices would be charged. ",
            "This caused shortages and surpluses of goods, as well as widespread corruption. ",
            "In Ancient Greece, by contrast, many different city-states had their independent economies (Heriyanto 75). ",
            "There was no central authority dictating what should be produced or how much should be produced; rather, merchants and traders decided what to sell based on the products available.\n",
            "The two civilizations had different cultural beliefs that led to different economic systems. ",
            "In Mesopotamia, there was a strong belief in gods and goddesses, which led to the creation of temples and religious ceremonies. ",
            "This led to a strong sense of community and cooperation, which helped create a thriving economy (Adams 33). ",
            "In ancient Greece, on the other hand, there was a belief in human rationality and individualism. ",
            "This led to the development of philosophy and democracy, which helped create a prosperous society.\n",
            "Another difference between these two civilizations is their respective attitudes toward warfare. ",
            "The Mesopotamians were a warrior culture, and war was an integral part of their society (Frahm 109). ",
            "Homer\u2019s Iliad, which recounts the Trojan War, is an example of this type of literature. ",
            "The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were not a warrior culture. ",
            "The ideal citizen in a Greek city-state participated in politics and cultivated his mind and body. ",
            "The Mesopotamian sculpture is characterized by its realism and its emphasis on the power and strength of the human figure. ",
            "Another key difference between these two cultures is that the Greeks placed a strong emphasis on individualism and self-expression, while Mesopotamian culture was more focused on maintaining social order and tradition.\n",
            "There are several cultural similarities between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. ",
            "For example, both cultures were highly patriarchal, with men holding power in both the private and public spheres (Frahm 107). ",
            "Both cultures were also quite advanced in terms of their technological developments; for example, the Greeks were some of the first people to develop a system of writing. ",
            "On the other hand, the Mesopotamians were responsible for developing some of the earliest forms of mathematics and astronomy.\n",
            "In conclusion, Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations may be compared and contrasted in a variety of ways. ",
            "Greeks were famed for their strong sense of democracy, whereas Mesopotamians were controlled by kings and queens. ",
            "Conversely, Mesopotamia was ruled by a theocracy, whereas a democratic system ruled Greece. ",
            "Ancient Greece was well-known for its various exports, but Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural culture. ",
            "Aside from language and religion, the two civilizations were culturally distinct. ",
            "Cuneiform writing was established by the Mesopotamians, whereas the Greek alphabet is still in use today. ",
            "Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in that each city-state was headed by a monarch who exercised absolute power over his territory. ",
            "A commonality across societies is that males had authority in both the private and public arenas. ",
            "Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek society, politics, economy, and culture are different and similar to one another.\n",

            "Microsoft Power BI is an intriguing data visualization tool (Bansal and Upadhyay 14; Hadhoud and Walid 5). ",
            "Power BI consists of various components that are available on the market separately and can be purchased and used independently, such as Power BI Desktop, Power BI Embedded, Power BI Gateway, and Power BI Mobile Apps.\n",
            "When it was first sold\n",
            "In 2010, Microsoft came up with the concept for this tool. ",
            "In July 2011, it was made publicly available for download under the name \u201cProject Crescent.\u201d It took three months for the Office 365 add-in to be published under the new Power BI brand (Senter 44). ",
            "After that, Power Pivot, Power Query, and Power View were thereafter exclusively accessible as Microsoft Excel add-ins (Becker and Gould 185). ",
            "Power BI Gateway was integrated with various features, such as enterprise-level data connectors and security settings. ",
            "Power BI was then released for sale with all its current full-fledged features for the first time on July 24, 2015. ",
            "Today, Power BI remains a popular data visualization tool.\n",
            "Main customers\n",
            "Firms in the professional services sector are the largest customer group (16.3%), followed by the manufacturing sector (13.2%), the financial services sector (8.6%), and the healthcare sector (7.1%). ",

            "Key strengths of Power BI\n",
            "Power makes creating straightforward dashboards and dynamic reports a breeze. ",
            "Power BI is known for its customizable dashboards, which can be tailored to a company\u2019s unique needs (Becker and Gould 185). ",
            "There are also interactive and intuitive visualizations included in the bundle. ",
            "Drag-and-drop capabilities may also be used to quickly create bespoke reports (Microsoft Power BI). ",
            "It also provides access to data that is updated in real-time. ",
            "Therefore, the dashboard shows and updates a user\u2019s visualizations as new data is streamed in.\n",
            "Weakness of Power BI\n",
            "Power BI is not designed for analyzing complicated table-to-table connections. ",
            "Power BI might not be able to handle intricate table connections. ",
            "Second, while Power BI allows you to modify your visualizations, it does not give users many options (Becker and Gould 185). ",

            "The software is simple to learn and utilize (Lyon 167). ",
            "The second interesting feature is the Pivot Point. ",
            "In-memory data models are created by importing and combining diverse datasets from various sources. ",
            "As a result, by combining data from different sources, functional users can quickly increase the total value.\n",
            "Another significant feature is query power. ",
            "This component seeks data from various corporate data sources or on the internet and then inserts it into an Excel table in a fluid manner (Mahajan and Gokhal 200). ",
            "In addition, Power View is necessary for interacting with and seeing data (Lyon 167). ",
            "It is constructed in this way to emphasize and cross-filter the data (Khalid and Zeebaree 65). ",
            "Finally, depending on the complexity of the data, the Power Bi tool gives a default standard that is generally insufficient for enterprises. ",
            "As a result, it provides bespoke, visualized dashboards.\n",
            "Does non-Tableau data visualization have any uses that Tableau does not?\n",
            "Power BI does not have any uses that Tableau does not have. ",
            "Comparing the two, it appears that both can display data visualizations from multiple reports (Akhtar 29). ",
            "However, Power BI only has an edge when it comes to ease of use and real-time access to data (Becker and Gould 185). ",

            "Modern Globalization in Business Essay\n",
            "Globalization has indeed become a significant pattern in the development of geopolitical and cultural practices of recent decades. ",
            "With the advent of the Internet, people have become connected, even across continents: such a powerful catalyst could not fail to have a necessary consequence. ",
            "In particular, people from different countries and cultures have become more integrated into a common, emerging culture in which there is room for the traditions of all peoples. ",
            "Meanwhile, the representation of different cultures in this common one is unequal, which means that stronger national cultures can absorb weaker ones.\n",
            "A natural reaction to the unification of people was the growth of nationalistic sentiments among peoples whose cultures tend to be weaker. ",
            "Thus, the spread of American sentiment (and especially the American dream) to the world often results in people from other regions becoming indifferent to their culture. ",
            "In addition, globalization can lead to the destruction of the sovereignty of vulnerable communities: for example, if the big powers (the United States, China, Russia, Britain) suppress the development of small neighboring ones (Hawaii, Hong Kong, Abkhazia, or former British colonies). ",
            "Healthy nationalism is not a problem because communities desire to protect themselves and preserve their cultural and political independence. ",
            "However, radical, violent actions on the part of nationalists lead to international conflicts and inhibit globalization.\n",
            "Thus, globalization should not be evaluated regarding whether it is good or bad. ",
            "Instead, it should be seen as a natural milestone in the evolution of humanity. ",
            "Globalization does have advantages and disadvantages, but it is a fact in and of itself. ",
            "The world now finds itself incredibly integrated, as every individual can learn news from another continent, listen to foreign music, and read non-domestic literature in a matter of minutes. ",
            "This results in a new, shared culture. ",
            "In this state, radical nationalism is a serious problem that society and governments must confront.\n"

            "There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. ",
            "Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. ",
            "For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. ",
            "It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. ",
            "This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions.\n",
            "In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. ",
            "According to him, \u201cwe have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate\u201d (Onbeing.org 30:53 \u2013 30:58). ",
            "The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a \u201cright to continue making mistakes\u201d (Onbeing.org 31:15 \u2013 31:20). ",
            "Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. ",
            "In other words, being human is about being humane. ",
            "People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). ",
            "Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. ",
            "From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. ",
            "Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living.\n",
            "Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. ",
            "The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. ",

            "Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. ",
            "However, this \u201cWestern model,\u201d according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. ",
            "It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. ",
            "Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. ",
            "Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media.\n",
            "For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. ",
            "Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. ",
            "Lerner states, \u201cFrom the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently\u201d (Lerner 47). ",
            "The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress.\n",
            "I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from \u201cbackwardness\u201d to \u201cmodernity\u201d was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. ",
            "Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). ",

            "Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. ",

            "Music already a long time ago became one of the most significant and most profitable business fields that serve not only to entertain the public but also to be a platform for commercial and appearing trends. ",
            "Major record labels determine what kind of music they will continue to promote and focus on the preferences of the majority of the population. ",
            "Technology as well contributed to how listeners embrace the songs and interpret the lyrics. ",
            "Thus, the essay aims to analyze the role of the music industry on the variety of choices for the consumers and the impact of the technologies on musical comprehension.\n",
            "The music industry, like any other, has its tendencies, and it dictates what genre is going to be popular and what types of songs listeners will hear the most often on the radio. ",
            "Although there are a great diversity of musical compositions and mixes of different styles, only a significantly smaller number of music types have become and remain popular among the masses. ",
            "Record labels have a tendency to keep producing and promoting music which is similar to what has already proven itself as public favorites (Rosenthal and Flacks 69). ",
            "Rarely do labels agree to implement the atypical sound which is unfamiliar to the population. ",
            "Moreover, musicians assigned to any record company have to follow its requirements and write songs that are approved by the management (Rosenthal and Flacks 68). ",
            "Since they are in charge of the image and the final product, they use the latest technological innovations for promotion and marketing purposes.\n",
            "Technologies undoubtedly influence how music is perceived and interpreted by the audience nowadays. ",
            "When there were no music videos, performances translated on television, or massive shows holding the stadium, people had more freedom of interpreting lyrics. ",
            "Due to the fact that there were no additional factors that could suggest or demonstrate the message, the listeners had an endless possibility of adapting the music lyrics to their own feelings (Rosenthal and Flacks 63). ",
            "Especially when the singer does not claim any sense of the song, it leaves the audience with the possibility of explaining it in numerous ways.\n",
            "However, music videos may add some additional context to the song that, in other cases, probably would not appear in people\u2019s minds. ",
            "Depending on the scenario that is happening in the music video, the viewer can start perceiving the lyrics precisely based on the image they saw on the screen or accepting the proposed context (Rosenthal and Flacks 63). ",
            "Live performances and those translated on the television also play a role in presenting the song. ",
            "The performer\u2019s attitude, style, and manner can shift the perception of the song in an entirely diverse direction than the audience\u2019s initial reaction. ",
            "Moreover, with the developing technologies and access to the internet, people gained a chance to participate in the discussions and share their opinion about the musicians and their art on online platforms (Rosenthal and Flacks 64). ",
            "Admirers of someone\u2019s art can express their opinions on the lyrics, music video, and the whole concept creating new theories and meanings about the message that one or another song might contain.\n",
            "Overall, considering the music industry from a commercial perspective, the labels aim to maintain the audience\u2019s attention without implementing radical and unusual innovations. ",
            "They rather stick to the familiar products that have already proved their applicability to the audience and have greater access to music that applies to more people. ",
            "Additionally, through the technological promotion by music videos and commercials public forms different perceptions of the music and lyrics. ",
            "Still, the meaning can often come to the listeners from their personal experiences, feelings, and memories that may be somehow associated with the songs.\n",

            "The performance was held on March 5, 2020, and I attended on the same day. ",
            "It brought me unforgettable memories, enough to be reflected in the corresponding essay.\n",
            "The performance was filled with music by many composers who contributed to the development of classical music. ",
            "The concert begins with a work by Ottorino Respighi, an Italian composer who studied at the Bologna Lyceum, and then with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in St. ",
            "Petersburg, where he was the first violist in the Opera Orchestra ( Ottorino Respighi ). ",
            "His active training throughout his life endowed the composer\u2019s works with a unique orchestral flavor. ",
            "The concert ends with a piece by Ludwig van Beethoven, known to the general public for his heroic struggle with the onset of deafness when some of his most important works were written ( Ludwig van Beethoven ). ",
            "The musical compositions of these authors formed the basis for a concert that touched the heart and soul of every listener in the hall.\n",
            "The set of instruments was typical for conducting an orchestral concert. ",
            "The professional orchestra group was endowed mainly with string instruments: the cello, double bass, violin, viola, and harp. ",
            "As the largest group on stage, the string family accounted for more than half of the total number of performers. ",
            "They were also accompanied by wind instruments, which sit together in the middle of the orchestra, percussion, and piano. ",
            "Together, they created a holistic and harmonious sound with each new composition played at the concert.\n",
            "The orchestra concert was attended by eminent composers of our time, contributing to the development of musical culture. ",
            "For example, international pianist Peter Orth was acclaimed as a special guest artist and soloist for the concert. ",
            "His career in the American mainstream began after the first prize at the International Piano Competition in Naumburg in 1979, held in memory of William Capell (Peter Orth, Piano). ",

            "Claudia Chudacoff as a visiting concertmaster and associate conductor Jeffrey Newberger, conducted the opening piece, setting the mood till the end of the concert. ",
            "The other members of the orchestra also coped with their work perfectly and provided the audience with an evening of high-quality and sensual music.\n",
            "The concert starts with Ottorino Respighi\u2019s Botticelli Triptych, which is the memory of three famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli. ",
            "The piece is followed by Beethoven\u2019s early masterpieces, Concerto No. ",

            "All the music played during the performance belongs to the genre of an orchestral concert, although it affects differently due to differences in musical moods. ",
            "The lightness of the first piece and the fleur of sadness of Beethoven\u2019s compositions contrasted perfectly with each other, quietly flowing from one to the other.\n",

            "Each section brought a new mood to the overall picture, which was noticeably reflected in the course of the music. ",
            "The first part was divided into three, each of which adhered to the light and fresh moods characteristic of the mentioned triptych. ",
            "In this part, more attention was paid to the quality of the compositions, which is why I could not stop admiring the orchestra\u2019s skills. ",
            "The second part of the concert can also be divided into two parts, the first of which was more majestic, the second, on the contrary, sadder and more relaxed. ",
            "This created a pleasant picture of a smooth flow of sound from one mood to another. ",
            "The feelings I had towards the end of the performance may be described as excited and joyful because of the corresponding brutality. ",
            "The music maintained a course for a constant change of moods until the end and caused a storm of emotions with its bright ending.\n",
            "The orchestra\u2019s melody may be defined as undulating since the filling of the jumps occurred with a gradual movement either up or down, which made it possible to achieve an easy and natural development of the composition. ",
            "The major triad of the first passage was replaced by a minor triad, shimmering from joy to calmness, from admiration to sadness. ",
            "The polyphonic warehouse made it possible to highlight several main themes at once during the concert. ",
            "The high register of the whole concert did not stop even in the last notes, allowing to simplify and facilitate the figurative series.\n",

            "Poe\u2019s narrative is way darker in this regard, leading a reader not to expect the confession of a murderer, who is suddenly disturbed my \u2018a heart pounding\u2019.\n",
            "Poe often employs dramatic irony, such as the narrator\u2019s kindness to an elderly man a week before he murders him. ",
            "The reader would not anticipate the narrator to be courteous to the elderly guy before killing him, therefore thus being a dramatic irony. ",
            "Another ironic metaphor is situational, as the elderly gentleman keeps his windows securely shut due to his fear of intruders (Alsahafi). ",

            "In both stories, the authors deal with impoverished protagonists who are going through a difficult time. ",
            "This makes another point of comparison between stories. ",

            "Pentecostal Movements Legitimacy Essay\n",
            "Pentecostal movements adhere to some doctrines that are contested by most Christian denominations, whether it be the Eastern Church or the Western Church. ",
            "Sometimes their movements are treated as sects, still, they are not recognized as destructive. ",
            "The big denominations will never come to a consensus with the Pentecostals on a number of issues. ",
            "By most denominations, Pentecostals cannot be considered as a legitimate movement.\n",
            "Nontrinitarianism rests on the assertion that God is one, there is neither the Holy Spirit, emanating from him, nor his Son, the same divine being. ",
            "The Bible usually states the trinity of God: \u201cFor the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval\u201d (Romans 14:17-18). ",
            "Pentecostals reject the divine nature of Jesus Christ altogether, acting as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n",
            "Pentecostal Arianism is about ridding the figure of Jesus Christ of all that is divine. ",
            "This doctrine is completely contrary to most denominations and confessions, where it is customary to say of Jesus Christ: \u201cHe is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation\u201d (Colossians 1:15). ",
            "The degree of the divine and the human in Jesus Christ has been the subject of discussion for a very long time, still, the complete elimination of the divine from his figure is not possible.\n",
            "The Pentecostal movement does not recognize the Apocrypha, and considers only the Bible to be a genuine subject for study. ",
            "This, in general, makes Pentecostal in some way a bookish religion, similar to Islam. ",
            "In Latin language, the principle of the inspiration of the Bible sounds like \u2018Sola Sriptura\u2019. ",
            "There can be no additions to the Bible, and other authorities are considered illegitimate. ",
            "Interpretations of the Bible are also prohibited and are not considered authoritative.\n",
            "Like Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals do not believe in hell. ",
            "This is contrary to the principles of the mercy of God who cannot send his children to eternal torment. ",
            "There are usually contradictions here too: \u201cAnd shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth\u201d (Matthew 13:42). ",
            "This is what divine love is: in saving people from eternal punishment. ",
            "In conclusion, Pentecostals have a few differences from other Christian denominations and are unlikely to ever come to a consensus, therefore, these denominations cannot legitimize them.\n",

            "Personal Experience of the COVID-19 Pandemic Essay\n",
            "The COVID-19 outbreak was a sudden and terrifying experience for all people around the world. ",
            "I remember telling my friends that the virus would not last for a long time and that we would all meet after two weeks of self-isolation. ",
            "I did not know how far it would go and what changes to my life it would bring. ",
            "Sitting at home and watching the news about millions of infected and fatal cases made me realize how fragile human life is. ",
            "The pandemic has both positive and negative effects on people and their businesses. ",
            "This paper addresses these effects and provides my experience of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis.\n",
            "The virus that is still ongoing has taught a valuable thing for all of us that is being able to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. ",
            "You will never know what is waiting for you in the future, and you should be flexible and calm enough to embrace the new reality. ",
            "At the beginning of the pandemic, it was fun to sit at home, watch TV series and chat with my friends. ",
            "Yet, after some time, I realized how my mental health was going downwards as I started to feel anxiety about the world and my future. ",
            "I also felt very sorry for people who lost their close ones because of COVID. ",
            "However, I somehow managed that stress due to mental health support, podcasts, and books. ",
            "I realized that being able to adapt to a changing reality is the only way to keep doing daily routines. ",
            "At a country level, countries were also adapting and making new policies, and I think now many political figures are more flexible being aware of sudden changes. ",
            "There were too many mistakes to realize the importance of effective and fast decisions that take into account today\u2019s reality.\n",
            "One more positive thing about the pandemic is that people learned the value of family and socialization. ",
            "People cannot live alone, and they need someone to rely on and care for. ",
            "During the pandemic, I was with my family, and I think it was the first time interacting with them so closely. ",
            "We were discussing the situation and sharing personal concerns a lot, so that I could understand my family more and support them. ",
            "I was also worried about older members of the family, thinking that I did not appreciate time with them before the pandemic. ",
            "It made me reconsider my family relations and understand that they are my close ones, and I should dedicate my time to them more. ",
            "I assume this was a great lesson for everyone, and I hope people would value their families and take care of them.\n",
            "One of the crucial changes that the COVID-19 outbreak brought to us is online education. ",
            "I did not know how to assess such kind of education as positive or negative as there are many arguments for each side. ",
            "Personally, I liked the online mode of the studies because I could also register for other courses provided for free by different universities and platforms like Coursera. ",
            "I also learned how to manage time properly as the increased number of assignments forced me to do so. ",
            "Yet, many students did not like online education as we could not focus well on our studies. ",
            "People live in different conditions, some of us did not have personal space for studying while others did not have time for education. ",
            "Education is indeed a privilege, but the online mode made it even worse. ",
            "Moreover, I heard that in some countries, students climbed on trees to have access to the Internet and do their homework.\n",
            "The COVID-19 crisis increased inequality across the world and had a negative impact on the world economy. ",
            "People in developing countries did not have proper healthcare services and tools for online mode of working and studying. ",
            "Many people lost their jobs, being unable to sustain their families. ",
            "Such conditions raised crime rates, unemployment rates, and global hunger, putting many countries in a hard socio-economic situation. ",
            "Furthermore, the virus split people into two categories of supporters of vaccination and those who are against it. ",
            "This division between people caused social disturbances that made the healthcare crisis turn into an ideological fight. ",
            "People were making up some stories regarding the COVID-19 and not contributing to the solution of the outbreak. ",
            "In my opinion, such a response of the public is expected as the general mass wanted answers that government officials did not have. ",
            "As such, the government should be very careful on how to communicate with citizens.\n",
            "Overall, there is much to say about the effects of Covdi-19. ",
            "For me, it was an experience of taking care of my mental health and being close to my family. ",
            "For the world, it has resulted in disrupted economies, increased inequality, and loss of lives. ",
            "I hope the crisis made people rethink their lives and be supportive of others. ",
            "I also believe that the world would not be the same after the end of COVID-19 if it actually has an end.\n"

            "Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth album of Pink Floyd, the British rock quartet. ",
            "Since 1973 when it was released, it has been regarded as one of the greatest rock albums in the history of music. ",
            "In the present day, it definitely deserves listeners\u2019 attention, and its analysis may substantially contribute to self-assessment and self-development. ",
            "The purpose of this paper is to investigate Dark Side of the Moon from the positions of meanings, sounds, and influence on individuals. ",
            "Characterized by an extraordinary thoughtfulness, clear conception, and the coherence of lyrics and sounds, Dark Side of the Moon still has a massive impact on human society, reflecting people\u2019s attitude to life, death, madness, money, violence, choice, and social norms.\n",
            "Dark Side of the Moon may be justly regarded as one of the greatest albums in the history of rock music, if not the most outstanding one. ",
            "According to Epstein, who wrote for Rolling Stone magazine, \u201cthere are hit albums, and then there\u2019s Dark Side of the Moon \u201d (par. ",
            "1). ",
            "Recorded in several sessions from May 1972 to January 1973 at London\u2019s Abbey Road Studios, Pink Floyd\u2019s eighth album has become commercially successful after its release, with more than 45 million copies sold worldwide (Epstein par. ",
            "1). ",
            "At the same time, Dark Side of the Moon is more than a top bestseller that stayed in charts for breathtakingly many weeks \u2013 it has managed to affect its creators and the rock music of the next generations as well. ",
            "First of all, it was the artistic achievement of Pink Floyd that defined the British quartet\u2019s career and turned an experimental and jam-oriented band loved by college students into worldwide renowned top-echelon rockers. ",
            "At the same time, the album\u2019s rich songwriting, heavy lyrical musings, and cerebral soundscapes led to people\u2019s countless listening sessions, set quality standards for future albums, and inspired other musicians.\n",
            "One of the major values of Dark Side of the Moon lies in its conception and thoughtfulness. ",
            "In comparison with the majority of studio albums that imply a series of unrelated or unconnected songs, Pink Floyd\u2019s well-written masterpiece includes a general theme addressed by all songs. ",
            "As a matter of fact, there are multiple theories and disputes concerning the album\u2019s concept and general meaning. ",
            "Although Pink Floyd has partly provided the explanation of particular songs, listeners have been mostly given an opportunity to reflect and decide for themselves.\n",
            "From a personal perspective, Dark Side of the Moon is about life and its shortness, the importance of living and being human, finding the purpose in life, factors that may impact its fulfillment, and death. ",
            "At the same time, the album may be regarded as a warning to people about challenges in life that may affect its fragility and lead to insanity and destruction. ",
            "In other words, \u201cBreathe,\u201d \u201cSpeak to Me,\u201d \u201cTime,\u201d \u201cThe Great Gig in the Sky,\u201d and \u201cOn the Run\u201d are tracks that may be grouped according to their focus on people\u2019s perceptions and multiple aspects of life including its futility and shortness, fear of death, the boredom of routine, parenthood, luck, and the freedom of choice.\n",
            "In turn, other tracks, such as \u201cUs and Them,\u201d \u201cMoney,\u201d \u201cAny Colour You Like,\u201d \u201cEclipse,\u201d and \u201cBrain Damage\u201d address ideas and concepts that cause destruction, madness, and uncertainty or despair related to life reflected in the album\u2019s other tracks. ",
            "They are selfishness, greed, social pressure, violence, wars, racism, common insanity, and hidden negative feelings. ",
            "Thus, Dark Side of the Moon helps listeners realize that the pursuit of material things, social approval, and public acceptance lead to dissatisfaction with life and recognition of its futility.\n",
            "The meaning of the album corresponds with the ideas of individualism that were spread in the 1970s. ",
            "According to Thompson, \u201cby the 1970s, society had lost its constraining power and individualism became a matter of self-absorption and the quest for self-development\u201d (851). ",
            "Thus, concepts reflected in Dark Side of the Moon helped young people to understand themselves better and perceive the ways in which their lives could be fulfilled.\n",
            "At the same time, listening to the album may be highly beneficial for individuals today, especially millennials who \u201cmore than any other generation, are searching for purpose and purposeful work\u201d (Grant 1). ",
            "Regarded as materialistic, narcissistic, and individualistic, they are concentrated on ambitions, achievements, and competitiveness. ",
            "However, young people are frequently confused about life balance and their purpose in this world. ",
            "For them, the album may serve as a source of wisdom and consistency, reminding that searching for truth is natural. ",
            "It shows that life itself is highly important and appreciating every moment of it is paramount. ",
            "In turn, there are multiple detrimental concepts, ideas, and events that may limit life fulfillment and lead to despair and madness \u2013 they should be understood to be avoided.\n",
            "In general, the album\u2019s reflection of society may be defined as timeless. ",
            "In the present day, pandemic-related circumstances limit people\u2019s ability to enjoy life. ",
            "Tragic news, the lockdown measures, misinformation, global tiredness from multiple restrictions, and isolation lead to anxiety, helplessness, anger, and more serious health problems. ",
            "The album\u2019s message resonates with individuals\u2019 emotional state \u2013 for example, \u201cThe Great Gig in the Sky\u201d reflects people\u2019s attitude to death, either acceptance of fear, \u201cUs and Them\u201d is about conflicts that prevail in the modern world due to restrictions, discrimination, and inequities, while \u201cOn the Run\u201d express stress, anxiety, fear, and the senseless of life. ",
            "All in all, Pink Floyd\u2019s album emphasizes the inconstancy of life. ",
            "Although there are bright and positive moments, they are inevitably changed by bleakness and even horrors that will pass as well. ",
            "However, listeners can interpret songs in numerous different ways finding individual meanings that describe what they feel in a particular life period.\n",
            "The whole album may be perceived as a journey for people who want to understand the importance of being a human, being alive, and life in general, uncover it, and find their purpose. ",
            "It opens with a relatively long and cinematic introduction with the crescendo of heartbeat accompanied by distant voices, ticking clocks, and sound effects that resemble an airplane propeller, automobile motor, cash register, and arcade machine. ",
            "It is possible to say that \u201cSpeak to Me\u201d introduces life both within and outside a human being with its rhythm, dynamic, and pace. ",
            "Listeners may identify a clear phrase, \u201cI\u2019ve always been mad,\u201d that indicates society\u2019s influence on the development of its members\u2019 mental issues (\u201cSpeak to Me\u201d 00:00:44). ",
            "However, when \u201cBreathe\u201d starts, slide and chorused guitars, ride-cymbal drum kit, and bass enter all together, creating warm and delicious merging tones (\u201cBreathe\u201d 00:01:09). ",
            "They replace the sounds of life, offering listeners to distract their attention from routine and explore another dimension in search of truth.\n",
            "In general, \u201cBreathe\u201d represents the ideas of the shortness of life and its futility at the same time when people focus on the endless achievement of non-existing ideals, competition, and toil. ",
            "On the basis of its message, the may be divided into parts, and one may be regarded as a parent\u2019s guidance:\n",
            "Run, rabbit, run\n",
            "Dig that hole, forget the sun\n",
            "And when at last the work is done\n",
            "Don\u2019t sit down it\u2019s time to dig another one\n",
            "For long you\u2019ll live, and high you\u2019ll fly\n",
            "But only if you ride the tide\n",
            "And balanced on the biggest wave\n",
            "You race towards an early grave (\u201cBreathe\u201d)\n",
            "In these lines, the importance of continuous hard work is emphasized, however, it is senseless as even if success is achieved, non-stop \u201crace\u201d will inevitably lead to early death. ",
            "In turn, the author states that the purpose of a person is in an everyday living as life is positive and negative moments that constitute it, and only they should be valued:\n",
            "Breathe, breathe in the air\n",
            "Don\u2019t be afraid to care\n",
            "Leave, don\u2019t leave me\n",
            "Walk around and choose your own ground\n",
            "Long you live and high you fly\n",
            "Smiles you\u2019ll give and tears you\u2019ll cry\n",
            "All you touch and all you see\n",
            "Is all your life will ever be (\u201cBreathe\u201d)\n",
            "Although the next track, \u201cOn the Run,\u201d is predominantly instrumental, the theme of time passage is clearly recognizable. ",
            "At the same time, the message of this song is controversial. ",
            "On the one hand, it expresses people\u2019s constant \u201crace\u201d for career achievements, money, or fame and related anxiety and stress. ",
            "Moreover, airport announcements and a person\u2019s steps scattered throughout it reflect the dynamic and rhythm of life. ",
            "In other words, people forget to live being constantly on the run. ",
            "On the other hand, this tempo symbolizes living on the spot, and a person\u2019s words \u201cLive for today, gone tomorrow\u201d support this theory (\u201cOn the Run\u201d 00:01:52). ",
            "In any case, life is short and may finish suddenly and unexpectedly \u2013 in this song, life is probably compared with a plane that has crashed in the end.\n",
            "In a genuine masterpiece, \u201cTime,\u201d various concepts of time are explored. ",
            "In addition, this song may be regarded as a person\u2019s attitude to time during his life.\n",
            "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day\n",
            "You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.\n",
            "Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown\n",
            "Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.\n",
            "Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.\n",
            "You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.\n",

            "Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend any event or concert with a cultural dance performance. ",
            "However, I remember well the TV program, part of which was dedicated to New Zealand\u2019s indigenous peoples and their unique culture. ",
            "The event was filmed in New Zealand and was called the traditional Poi dance; the date of the event is unknown to me, but I watched the program in December 2021. ",
            "It was not the first time I saw cultural dance performances, but it was one of the most impressive.\n",
            "Poi dance is performed by large groups of Maori men and women who perform synchronized dance moves. ",
            "The movements are quite simple and include mainly stepping from one foot to the other and active movements of the arms and hands. ",
            "Additionally, women often spin around their axis and also walk one after another in lines. ",
            "Specific actions also include interaction with special balls, bars, and sticks by each woman as additional objects, as well as singing. ",
            "The theme of this dance is the traditional culture of the Maori people, in particular the expression of joy and gratitude.\n",
            "The most important movement theme in this dance is the interaction with various objects such as balls, bars, and sticks. ",
            "Each of the women starts the dance with small fluffy balls, then moves to short white bars, and then they are replaced by sticks. ",
            "The rhythm is set throughout the dance by clapping and singing, and the interaction with these objects is the center of the action and determines the movement. ",
            "For example, women actively moved by stepping from foot to foot and moving their arms with balls in their hands, while with bars, they mostly sat in a circle. ",
            "Additionally, bars and sticks were used to set the rhythm when they were banged on the floor or against each other.\n",
            "The cultural significance of this dance lies in the preservation and demonstration of the traditions of the Maori people. ",
            "In particular, through such mass dances, they show the identity of their people and interact with each other. ",
            "I think it was the collectivity and mass character that impressed me the most. ",

            "A pressure ulcer can be defined as localized damage to the skin and soft tissue underneath as a result of intense or prolonged pressure, or pressure combined with shear. ",
            "The prevalence of pressure ulcers has remained relatively consistent in the United States, affecting nearly 3 million adults. ",
            "However, healthcare costs have been increasing and pressure ulcers, if left untreated, can cause severe health issues such as localized or general infection, or necrosis. ",
            "Approximately 60,000 people die from pressure ulcer adverse outcomes each year (Mervis and Phillips, 2019).\n",
            "Pressure ulcers can occur both during hospital stay or after discharge during homecare. ",
            "Many housebound adults who may be immobile due to age, injury, post-surgery recovery, or other illnesses are at-risk to develop pressure ulcers. ",
            "Unlike in hospitals, there is no regular nurse presence to aid in changing of positioning, dressings, or identifying ulcers early on. ",
            "Therefore, literature indicates thatan effective solution for adults in community settings is the use of pressure reducing surfaces. ",
            "At the most primitive level, there are recommendations to use pillow, cushions, or mattress pads to reduce the pressure and support the area (MedlinePlus, 2020).\n",
            "More complex interventions would be the use of pressure reducing support surfaces. ",
            "This is identified as durable medical equipment (DME) and used to care for pressure sores and ulcers. ",
            "Pressure reducing support surfaces can be split into three groups dependent on complexity. ",
            "Group 1 are surfaces meant to replace the mattress or serve as an overlay include specialized mattresses, pressure pads, and overlays from foam, water, or gel. ",
            "Group 2 is similar but includes more complex devices such air flotation beds and powered pressure reducing mattresses. ",
            "Finally, Group 3 are complete bed systems including air-fluidized beds which use circulation of filtered air (United Healthcare, 2021). ",
            "Pressure reducing support surfaces are meant to prevent pressure ulcers or contribute to the healing of existing sores. ",
            "This is achieved by limiting tissue interface pressure to the best possible extent, most often by improving circulation and conforming to the contours of the body and spreading pressure over wider areas of the body (Rae, Isbel and Upton, 2018). ",

            "In the piece under review, Putnam seeks to investigate the nature of pain, specifically, to identify whether it is a brain state or not. ",
            "He highlights the dissimilarity of brain structure in various forms of life through the example of an octopus and a mammal, from which the difference in their \u201cphysical-chemical\u201d functionality emerges (Putnam, p. ",
            "56). ",
            "Simply stated, the ways activity occurs in the brain may differ from one type of it to another. ",
            "This, according to Putnam, drives to the conclusion that physical responses most living creatures demonstrate, including pain, are not exclusively brain states.\n",
            "An essential nuance, at which the thinker points, is that such reactions normally manifest themselves in particular behavior that enables detecting the state. ",
            "For instance, it is possible to guess that a certain organism is experiencing pain, hunger, uncomfortable temperature, or other from its movements or the sounds it is emitting (Putnam, p. ",
            "56). ",
            "This serves to prove that the states are not limited to changes in brain activity, but can also determine its bodily equivalent; therefore, it is more reasonable to consider them complex. ",
            "Specifically, the term Putnam offers to classify basic physiological response to irritants, which interfere with the well-being of an organism, is \u201ca functional state\u201d (p. ",
            "54). ",
            "His hypothesis tells that to feel pain, a living creature needs to possess an appropriate type of functional organization, which actually determines this condition, making it physically possible.\n",
            "In the simplest terms, Putnam rejects the identical nature of mental and physical properties, which two hypothetically are intertwined up to inseparability. ",
            "Horowitz mentions that such a viewpoint falls under the philosophy of \u201ctype-physicalism\u201d (p. ",
            "81). ",
            "Meanwhile, Putnam labels it \u201cthe brain state theory\u201d (p. ",
            "55). ",
            "His main argument against it, as mentioned, rests on the fact that mental conditions can have various behavioral manifestations, therefore, they hardly share certain physical nature.\n",
            "Putnam\u2019s view doubtlessly is closer to reality in comparison with type-physicalism, primarily because of sufficient practical evidence. ",
            "In fact, different creatures may act dissimilarly when in pain; thus, they may twitch or shrink, cry, moan, or squeeze, or other. ",
            "Furthermore, several species, including humans but not limited to them, can camouflage their discomfort to avoid becoming excessively vulnerable. ",
            "These are the examples to illustrate that physiology-based response to irritants, such as pain, is \u201cmultiply realizable\u201d (Horowitz, p. ",
            "82). ",
            "This assumption, in turn, separates mental properties from physical since otherwise, all creatures that are able to feel pain would behave identically.\n",
            "It is worth noting that some philosophers attempted to compromise the validity of Putnam\u2019s argument, proclaiming that, although the nature of pain apparently is different in various species, it is identical in one. ",
            "This statement, however, is false as well; empirical data show that the functional structure of brain, including human, can transform. ",
            "For instance, a serious injury of particular brain areas can lead to a situation where the other begin to perform their functions, so that the organism returns to homeostasis (Horowitz, p. ",
            "82). ",
            "This actually is another scenario of how the realization of mental states can be multiple, which is observable even within one species. ",
            "Therefore, it is more relevant to classify pain as a function with the focus on the behavior that manifests it.\n",
            "To summarize, the hypothesis to which Putnam refers as the brain state theory and which he opposes strongly is doubtful. ",
            "Notably, the adepts of this view equalize mental states to physical, proclaiming that the former, including pain, share unique physical nature. ",
            "However, in such a case, actions of organisms in pain would be identical as well, which, as empirical evidence shows, does not correspond to reality.\n"

            "The study of historical facts about the fall of empires and republics still attracts the interest of many researchers. ",
            "This is due to the fact that the acquired knowledge can give valuable insight and help solve some problems in the modern world. ",
            "Thus, this scientific paper aims at how a series of racing strong military men and inter-class conflict influenced the fall of the Roman Republic. ",
            "I believe that both structural and individual problems contributed to its fall. ",
            "This is because they are in a direct relationship with each other. ",
            "An example may be the wrong decisions made by the ruler about economic policy, which will lead to a downturn in the economy and discontent among citizens. ",
            "Thus, this can cause subsequent problems with an incorrect solution, of which many problems can also accumulate. ",
            "This is precisely what happened to the Roman Republic, where the causes and consequences of problems influenced the disappearance of the empire.\n",
            "It was one of the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Republic, which led to other events that were problems related to the economy. ",
            "They followed after the end of multiple conquests and smoothly turned into political ones. ",
            "As is already known, thanks to historical sources, the final point was the murder of Caesar. ",
            "As a consequence of the multiple expansions of the lands of government, Roman citizens no longer had to pay taxes. ",
            "However, this wealth led to open corruption in the elections, and senators bought at the expense of considerable contributions to the election campaign (Arena 1). ",
            "Thus, these actions led to the establishment of various laws that worked toward the affluent classes.\n",
            "The figures who promoted the struggle for the rights of people, which arose because of the hole between the classes, were the Gracchi. ",
            "Both brothers pursued this idea and wanted to improve the lives of the lower classes of society. ",
            "In addition, due to the problem of unequal distribution of land, the Gracchi sought to seize land from the rich population, that is, representatives of the senatorial class. ",
            "With the help of this initiative, if such representatives of the lower classes, such as soldiers and peasants, were moved. ",
            "Another initiative was to provide subsidized grain to the needy and pay for the clothing of poor soldiers.\n",
            "Another reason that contributed to the fall of the Roman Republic was the optimates and populares. ",
            "The former was the dominant group in the Senate, and the representatives of the latter were their direct opponents. ",
            "The optimates were on the side of the oligarchy, and the popular focused more on popular support against the ruling oligarchy. ",
            "Thus, the power of the Senate was not based on the law, which led to the loss of legal control over the people.\n",
            "Equally essential figures were Marius and Sulla, who are considered symbols of the formation of chaos in Roman society. ",
            "Gaius Marius\u2019 reforms abolished the maniple system and replaced it with a single cohesive unit. ",
            "The consequence of this innovation was the formation of a contubernium. ",
            "Marius, because of his desire to rule, appealed to the will of the crowd and despised the traditions of the Senate. ",
            "As already mentioned, the decisive impetus for the fall of the republic was the assassination of Caesar. ",
            "During his activity, discontent grew strongly, and many feared that this negatively threatened the republic. ",
            "It was also fueled by the fact that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one person threatens democratic institutions. ",

            "Reasons Why Women Chose to Be Child-Free Essay\n",
            "The article highlighted multiple reasons why women chose to be child-free. ",
            "These include the desire to succeed from an academic and professional perspective, financial reasons, a lack of natural desires, and the understanding that a child would not enhance their life but rather make it more difficult (Sandler).\n",
            "There were a couple of things that I can\u2019t entirely agree with. ",
            "The choice of a woman to be in a serious relationship with a man with a 15-year-old daughter without taking even minimal parental responsibilities appears to be inconsiderate for the young girl both from the perspective of the childfree woman and the father who accepts such conditions. ",
            "Moreover, the statement that women are not more pressured into having children due to the possibilities does not correlate with the previous standards in which women who did not get married and have children had almost no opportunities in society.\n",
            "Based on the materials I have read, I would say that being child-free is a choice that everyone can make depending on the life goals and aspirations of the person. ",
            "On the one hand, a woman may be happy building a solid career and not have any desire to make changes for a child, which makes it unreasonable to have one unless love and care can be provided. ",
            "On the other hand, the majority of women are still opting to have children despite the possible difficulties that correlate with motherhood, including financial, professional, and social problems. ",
            "However, since every woman is different and living in a modern world means being able to make a choice, having or not having children is an individual decision that every person is to make based on their own life experiences and overviews.\n",

            "Although Lemuel Haynes and Mary Wollstonecraft discussed two distinct issues, slavery and female rights, the fundamental idea behind their works was that liberty and freedom should be equally distributed to all in a civilized society. ",
            "Haynes Liberty Further Extended and Wollstonecraft\u2019s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman were ahead of the time they were written. ",
            "In fact, Haynes claims that freedom is a naturally given gift to all human beings, regardless of race (242). ",
            "One of the renowned feminists of that time, Wollstonecraft, presented her ideas with a significant portion of anger, suggesting that women should be equally allowed to aspire to the same goals as men. ",
            "Indeed, virtuous existence is impossible if all people do not have the same opportunities to pursue their objectives and share their natural gifts. ",
            "This rhetoric analysis argues that both authors created the framework for defining the good life by claiming that rights and liberties are inherent to all people and thus they should not be withdrawn from someone.\n",
            "Individuals may perceive the good life differently, but it is impossible if people cannot use their talent, skills, and knowledge to attain specific goals. ",
            "Wollstonecraft stated that women could become better citizens if men \u201cbe content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience\u201d since females would become more \u201cobservant daughters, affectionate sisters, faithful wives, reasonable mothers\u201d (179). ",
            "Moreover, what is good or bad for one person is equally dignified or evil to others (Haynes 246). ",
            "Both authors agree that liberty is essential for all people, and this term can be defined as having uniform opportunities, freedom of expression, and equality before the law (Wollstonecraft 230). ",
            "If the law is threatened, people cannot attain a good life; thus, the more equality is present in society, the more virtuous it may become. ",
            "However, from policymakers\u2019 viewpoint, women were inferior creatures, allowing the government to create the environment that would enable men\u2019s success (Wollstonecraft 30). ",
            "In fact, Wollstonecraft\u2019s sarcastic tone in her writing suggests that the regulations of that time were hypocritic because they allowed white males to dominate and discriminate against individuals based on their race and gender.\n",
            "It is probably impossible to achieve virtuous life in a country if some groups are devoid of their rights or unaware of their options. ",
            "If only a portion of a group\u2019s potential is involved in decision-making, it cannot attain the highest potential. ",
            "Therefore, Wollstonecraft promoted the idea that women should acquire physical and emotional strengths to become fully functioning members of society; in that case, virtuous life will become possible (31). ",
            "Furthermore, the author seems appalled to elegance, delicacy, and gentleness, calling them the impediments to a good life (Wollstonecraft 31). ",
            "Wollstonecraft is not sarcastic about these characteristics, but she appears to feel offended by the fact that strength is men\u2019s privilege and a taboo for women. ",
            "Still, her tone is satirical when she talks about the male population\u2019s fear that if females are allowed to exercise and receive better education, they will become excessively masculine because it may not be attractive. ",
            "The author also believes that being eloquent should no longer be a priority in the world that strives to build a good life.\n",
            "Haynes did not use sarcasm or shaming language to claim that slavery is fundamentally wrong; instead, he chose to use the name of God to prove that liberty and freedom are divine gifts. ",
            "Therefore, these inherent rights cannot be taken from us \u201cwithout our consent\u201d (Haynes 247). ",
            "Since this natural law was violated through enslavement, society could not live a good life because some members were violently deprived of the opportunity to pursue their own ideas and develop their gifts. ",
            "Indeed, the author claims that since people all belong to one species, the same rules should be applied to everyone without giving privileges to particular groups (Haynes 246). ",
            "However, not only external factors can prevent one from achieving a virtuous objective. ",
            "In fact, a person\u2019s fears and prejudices, which are presented as shadows in Plato\u2019s Cave , may prevent someone from learning and growing. ",
            "Overall, a good life is possible if all people possess the liberty to seek knowledge and apply it because everyone will be producing equally good results. ",
            "Still, even equality and freedom may not save someone from failing to become better if one\u2019s mindset is incorrect.\n",
            "In summary, Haynes and Wollstonecraft used the framework of slavery and women\u2019s rights, respectively, to raise the issue of liberty. ",
            "Evaluating their works and the tone they used in their writings allowed me to understand that equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities are essential for society to reach a virtuous life. ",
            "Furthermore, applying analysis to these readings helped me see that emotional writings are as convincing as rational explanations as in the case of Wollstonecraft\u2019s and Haynes\u2019s works. ",
            "Indeed, Wollstonecraft\u2019s satirical tone came from her anger at men who deprived her of her natural rights to pursue a better future. ",
            "Haynes\u2019s essay lacks sarcasm, but the author is quite assertive that slavery must be eliminated.\n",

            "At the beginning, they seem to be a perfect couple, both content with their roles in the family. ",
            "However, as the play develops, they are revealing their unhealthy relationship and dissatisfaction. ",
            "Torvald treats his wife like a child incapable of making her own decisions. ",
            "He cares mostly about his money and reputation, and through his pressure and arrogance, he makes Nora believe that her life has to only be devoted to her husband and children. ",
            "Nora sees her purpose in the same way: all she does is try to make her husband happy. ",
            "Nora and Torvald\u2019s relationship shows that women\u2019s role as an individual was not always recognized, and that for many men, women were and still are simply \u201cdolls\u201d (Gardner et al., 2020). ",

            "The nation seemed headed in a path of economic stability, with everyone welcome to tag along, but this was a fallacy. ",
            "The Gilded Age was glorious on the surface but full of rot underneath. ",
            "It bled into the Progressive Era that aimed to correct the wrongs of the Gilded Age with arguably considerable success. ",
            "It was a period of heightened social activism. ",
            "In this paper, I look at the social injustices suffered by minority communities in these eras, how they sought to solve them, and the coverage of these critical periods of American history in the textbooks.\n",
            "Social Inequalities Experienced by Minority Groups\n",
            "One of the hallmarks of the Gilded Age was widespread inequality. ",
            "This form of injustice broadly took two forms; social and economic (Cashman, 293). ",
            "With the rise of corporations that offered jobs for everyone willing to work, streaming millions of immigrants from Europe and the Far East was a welcome sight; or so it was supposed to be. ",
            "It led to the advent of the deplorable state of workers in the republic. ",
            "The number of workers was more than the jobs, and mass unemployment followed. ",
            "The majority of the migrant population was unskilled, and the lack of factory jobs meant no income.\n",
            "Getting a job was not glorious, maybe just the lesser evil at best. ",
            "Workers in these companies run by overly shrewd businessmen who held productivity above all else were paid meager wages for their troubles. ",
            "They had to endure dangerous working conditions without compensation for injuries incurred while on the job. ",
            "This, coupled with the high rent charged by landlords, made the cost of living for the immigrants fresh off the boat. ",
            "So high was this cost that most immigrants were forced to live in crowded and sanitary and crime-riddled tenement yards, all in pursuit of the American Dream.\n",
            "Most of the social injustice during the Gilded Age was propagated by trusts and companies running monopolies and the \u2018robber barons\u2019 who wanted to effect full-scale capitalism. ",
            "Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and JPMorgan are among them. ",
            "To say that wealth distribution in the US was uneven will be a significant understatement. ",
            "Four thousand families, which formed 1% of the population, controlled as much wealth as 11.6 million. ",
            "The financial moguls that made their fortunes in various sectors of the economy insisted on production at whatever cost, a cost borne mainly by the working man. ",
            "The stories, such as one of Carnegie releasing a small army on his workers, are quite scary.\n",
            "Efforts to Address the Inequalities\n",
            "With the Progressive Era came reforms; people were teaming up to end the social injustice they had been under for so long. ",
            "The populist movement of Agrarian reforms, the antitrust movements, and the progressive movement of urban social reformers came up. ",
            "It became evident that the only way to be hard was not by individual action but by a coalesced effort to seek rights and fair treatment (Cole, 297). ",
            "Many policies to curtail inequality were formed and voiced. ",
            "The guideline\u2019s problem was that no infrastructure or groundwork was laid to make them politically feasible and practical.\n",

            "Loewen is quite critical of how textbooks today and in the past have presented the issue of class. ",
            "It is evident in Lies my Teacher Told Me . ",
            "He says there is a general absence of class analysis in American History textbooks. ",
            "It is almost impossible not to present class bias negatively; to avoid this and the controversy that would follow, textbooks give blandly positive accounts of history, sometimes not as it happened. ",
            "This is a conscious effort to propagate the notion of the American dream.\n",
            "Immigration which has been a crucial part of the nation\u2019s journey since independence from Great Britain is given an unfair and shallow chunk of the history textbooks. ",
            "They handle the topic in numbers, expressing statistics and non-descriptive information on the immigrants. ",
            "Their issues in their voyages to America and their new life on the continent take a back seat. ",
            "The only immigrants whose lives we get to know about are those that rose to fame by some act. ",
            "The same is true for African Americans and does nothing but further cement the rags-to-riches narrative, which, while motivating, finds itself blaming the poor man for his poverty.\n",
            "Loewen also implies that class bias in textbooks has been used as a tool to keep the rich getting their pockets deeper as they \u2018deserve\u2019 it and for the working class to accept their position in society. ",
            "In a bid to discredit class bias, textbooks bring it out as meaningless old disputes unworthy of remembrance (Loewen, 137). ",
            "Even the bills that strengthen the rich man\u2019s position are downplayed at the expense of the poor. ",
            "In chapter 7, Loewen blames society for class bias in textbooks. ",
            "Until recently, authors were labeled as Marxists for featuring class issues in their books. ",
            "With today\u2019s society looking ever so close to being a second gilded age, textbooks should be at the front of ensuring that social inequality does not recur.\n",
            "Progressive-era policies contributed to the deterioration of blacks, migrants, and workers. ",
            "Instead of reducing monopoly and inequality, the state created a super monopoly and elevated the struggle for privilege and rent-seeking as a principle. ",
            "Not everything is described truthfully in textbooks about how life was organized at that time. ",

            "A credit score is a number between 300 and 850 that reflects a consumer\u2019s creditworthiness. ",
            "Lenders use credit scores to assess the likelihood that a person will repay a loan on time. ",
            "A credit score is an indicator that helps one understand how safe it is to trust an organization with one\u2019s money. ",
            "Banks, insurance companies, non-state pension funds, and other financial institutions that work with private clients usually have such ratings. ",
            "A credit score can significantly impact financial performance as it plays a vital role in a lender\u2019s decision to offer a loan to a client. ",
            "People with a credit score below 640 are generally considered to be subprime borrowers and have poor chances of getting a loan, while those above 800 are considered excellent.\n",
            "The rating takes into account not only the current financial position of the subject, the amount of capital, the volume of debts, and the entire previous financial history. ",
            "A high credit rating means that it is practically safe to trust the subject with money because they have always paid their bills before, and now their position is relatively stable. ",
            "At the same time, a low rating means a substantial risk because the entity\u2019s business is not going very well, and it is highly likely that it may go bankrupt.\n",
            "There are three major credit reporting agencies in the United States, namely Experian, Equifax, and Transunion, that report, update, and store consumer credit histories. ",

            "Resistance and Revenge Among Slaves Essay\n",
            "Out of the various forms of resistance used by slaves, the one which exacted the best revenge is armed and organized rebellion. ",
            "The main reason is the fact that despite their failures in colonial America, the Haitian Revolution was a signal about slavery always being challenged. ",
            "One of the most common forms of resistance was sabotage of production by breaking tools, feigning illnesses, and slowing the work process. ",
            "However, these were mostly ineffective measures because they led to negotiations where masters benefited the highest. ",
            "In addition to sabotage, theft was also a form of resistance, where slaves stole certain goods for their own personal use. ",
            "It was done mainly due to poor living conditions, such as nutrition, among slaves, which is why food was the main target of theft. ",
            "It should also be noted that theft was justified from the slaves\u2019 perspective since they are their masters\u2019 property, and thus, how can a property steal the same owner\u2019s property?\n",
            "Unlike the previously daily forms of resistance, the flight was an overt resistance. ",
            "However, it was not effective because it led to harsher oversight and severe punishments. ",
            "Escaping was a risky endeavor with rather low chances of success with no widespread impact. ",
            "In addition, it was mostly men who had acceptable chances of successful flight. ",
            "Therefore, the most effective form of resistance with the best revenge was armed rebellion, such as the Haitian Revolution. ",
            "Although it was the only successful rebellion among many suppressed ones, the victory was not the main point. ",
            "The key message was the fact that slavery will never be tolerated and it always is challenged by slaves, and the Haitian Revolution\u2019s success was a reminder to masters that they will not be able to own slaves forever.\n"

            "In 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-05, which deferred the effective dates of Topic 606 and Topic 842 by one year. ",
            "This update gave private companies a much-needed relief, which was overwhelmed by numerous challenges associated with fighting off the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
            "Even though many companies had adopted the new revenue recognition policy, both preparers and auditors experienced significant difficulties applying the new accounting standards in practice. ",
            "The central problem was that the new standard, unlike GAAP, does not provide sufficient detail on the implementation rules. ",
            "Instead, it gives a theoretical basis similar to all industries, which leaves the details open for interpretation.\n",
            "There are several issues associated with revenue recognition that private companies face in all industries. ",
            "First, Topic 606 requires revenues to be recorded when or as the company satisfied a performance obligation, which does not allow the companies to recognize costs right away. ",
            "Second, there was a significant problem with variable consideration, as contractors needed to identify the most likely outcome and adjust the value of a contract. ",
            "Before Topic 606 was implemented, it was impossible to recognize revenues based on a claim. ",
            "Finally, the number of required disclosures increased significantly.\n",
            "Even though the majority of firms are ready to embrace the new regulations concerning leases, there are some problems associated with Topic 842. ",
            "These problems include identifying embedded leases, ensuring the accuracy of all the data associated with leases, and standardizing procedures about new leases, renewals, and modifications to let all the departments receive the required information timely. ",
            "Moreover, similar to changes in revenue recognition, changes of policy concerning leases now require more disclosures, which may affect the decision-making of investors.\n"

            "However, unlike men, women of the author\u2019s time were limited in their access to education and had few opportunities to broaden their horizons. ",

            "In this work, the Greek philosopher argues that one\u2019s perceptions may differ from reality, and people who are not allowed to receive knowledge will never know the real world (Plato). ",
            "Thus, Wollstonecraft believes that women, equally to men, should be allowed the right to education as it affects them and the world around them.\n",
            "In A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft insists that men and women are equal human beings and, therefore, should be offered the same rights and opportunities in life. ",

            "In saying this, Wollstonecraft holds men and women to the same moral standards and criticizes those who contend that a woman\u2019s role in society should be reduced to ornamental function and childbearing. ",
            "It can be argued that Wollstonecraft inspired the feminist movement, specifically, individualist feminist tradition, that emphasizes personal autonomy and individualism. ",

            "They embraced their African heritage from which they developed their music, art, and poetry. ",
            "Authors wrote novels and poems basing them on the way of life of the people in Harlem during that decade. ",
            "For instance, Zora Neale Hurston, a renowned writer and anthropologist wrote several novels that bore and applied similar themes as those of Harlem, the novel of choice is \u2018Their Eyes Were Watching God. ",

            "As much as the book portrays as a product of the rebirth, it also acts as a representative of the Harlem Renaissance. ",
            "The novel exemplifies the Harlem rebirth by accommodating various themes portrayed in the way people of Harlem lived and carried out their daily activities. ",
            "These themes include; racism, freedom, independence, language, power and conquest, love and relationship, and humanity. ",
            "Through these themes, the author can capture and present the Harlem sensation in her novel.\n",
            "The language being used by the novel\u2019s characters displays mastery of the southern dialect. ",
            "Hurston uses an exciting narrative structure by accommodating idioms and literary speech, which was common during the movement. ",
            "The characters of this novel are designed in a manner that long passages contain as much artistic voice as possible. ",
            "For instance, Janie\u2019s character has a distinctive use of grammar and vocabulary similar to the people of Harlem. ",

            "In such a situation, one can conclude that freedom of the press is not only in danger but practically non-existent, being swallowed up by political rhetoric. ",
            "The purpose of this paper is to analyze the situation with RT coverage of news about Ukraine through the prism of the Hutchins report on a free and responsible press.\n",
            "As Hutchins points out in his report, there are three dangers for news publishers and other media outlets. ",
            "Firstly, the strong development of such tools reduces the number of people who can express their will and broadcast their opinion. ",
            "This factor is reflected in the current RT activities since only specialized people can post news on their portals. ",
            "As one of the most massive pro-Russian voices, RT suppresses all other opinions, curtailing freedom of speech. ",
            "The second factor, according to Hutchins, is the failure to provide the news that society needs, despite having an opportunity. ",
            "RT covers news about Ukraine in a highly one-sided way, glorifying Russia and constantly pointing out the failures of Ukraine, exposing it in a negative light. ",
            "While people want objectivity from the news, RT uses its vast resources for propaganda. ",
            "Finally, the third factor is the use by press directors of methods condemned by society. ",
            "RT actively distorts the truth, presenting it in a light favorable for itself, which is a condemned practice unworthy of the press.\n",
            "According to Hutchins, state control of the press is the loss of a primary defense against totalitarianism. ",
            "In the context of RT and its coverage of news about Ukraine, it can be noted that this media tool is a direct instrument for spreading propaganda. ",
            "All the dangers to the free press described by Hutchins can be highlighted in the work of this structure, which indicates its incompetence as a reliable source of information. ",
            "Therefore, applying this report to the situation with RT and Ukraine, it can be concluded that this news resource does not belong to the free and responsible ones but promotes a clear political position sponsored by the Russian government.\n"

            "For example, Frankenstein says, \u201cMy dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher\u2019s stone and the elixir of life.\u201d (Shelley, 65). ",

            "In other words, drivers will be slow to react to light changes from red signal to green one. ",

            "Social Inequity in The Hunger Games by Collins Essay\n",
            "The disparities between the opportunities of simple citizens and the residents of the Capitol present the severe issue of social class differences in The Hunger Games. ",
            "However, the worst thing that happens to people is that they are used for the entertainment of those from the upper class. ",
            "Overall, Suzanne Collins highlights the social inequity between the residents of the twelve districts of Panem and the wealthier part of society in the Capitol, focusing on the cruelty of the so-called hunger games.\n",
            "To begin with, the story revolves around two characters, Peeta and Katniss, who live in the twelfth district of the Panem and suffer from the Capitol\u2019s cruelty. ",
            "To be more exact, their neighbors are starving and have to work hard to earn money just to provide for their families, \u201cDistrict Twelve. ",
            "Where you can starve to death in safety\u201d (24). ",
            "Katniss\u2019s family is beyond poor, so she is forced to hunt in illegal territories to get food for her sister and mother. ",
            "The girl\u2019s family has no conveniences in their house, so they cannot even shower or properly clean their clothes. ",
            "What is more, the twelve districts are forbidden to interact in any way, so people cannot travel outside of their areas or purchase food, clothes, and other necessities in the different parts of Panem.\n",
            "In contrast, the Capitol is thriving while the people of Panem work hard to survive. ",
            "As a matter of fact, the upper class does not share any worries about them lacking food, designer clothes, or technology to live their best lives. ",
            "On the contrary, almost every resident of the Capitol possesses a fancy car, estate, and everything that people from the twelve districts could not even imagine. ",
            "The capital is full of mean and two-faced people; they value looks and clothes over personality, \u201cThey do surgery in the Capitol to make people appear younger and thinner\u201d (124). ",
            "Consequently, Collins highlights the primary goal of the Capitol, which is making the lives of Panem worse and making people suffer (38). ",
            "The twelve districts do not even have an opportunity to obtain decent education because the Capitol cannot afford any rebellion from their side or people that may doubt their authority.\n",
            "However, the leading annual entertainment for the residents of the Capitol is hunger games, which include selecting two representatives from each of the twelve districts to fight for their lives. ",
            "This game ends when only one person from the 24 participants manages to survive. ",
            "Ironically, Catniss is forced to replace her sister, who is randomly chosen during the ceremony to participate in the hunger games. ",
            "Catniss and her neighbor fight for their lives when the Capitol just watches their struggles on the TV, screaming, \u201cHappy Hunger Games! ",
            "And may the odds be ever in your favor\u201d (78). ",
            "The most disturbing thing is that the upper class thinks that it is an actual honor for the participants to be seen and, besides, provided with necessities during the games if they are sponsored. ",
            "Overall, the Capitol cares only about its well-being and uses ordinary people from the lower classes across the districts for entertainment, where they starve, escape traps from opponents, and kill just to survive this horror.\n",
            "To sum up, Suzanne Collins presents the reality that the people of Panem have to deal with on a daily basis, trying to survive and provide for their families while the Capitol thrives on their struggles. ",
            "The capital residents consider themselves superior beings and think it is fitting to torture the same human beings as them just for their fun. ",
            "The fact that everyone\u2019s fear of the Capitol casts constant horror on Panem makes Catniss a selfless hero who fights for her people and does not fear losing her life in the process.\n",

            "Social return on investment measures how an organization adds value to the environment and communities (Bourey et al., 2015, p. ",
            "1). ",
            "The change is measured by evaluating the company\u2019s social, economic, and environmental outcomes, which are also the pillars of sustainable development. ",
            "Social return on investment is an ideal tool for measuring social impacts and should be employed in medium and large corporations.\n",
            "To achieve true sustainability, organizations report on three main aspects: financial gains, as well as social and environmental impacts of their activities, processes, and products (Bellucci et al., 2017, p. ",
            "47). ",
            "Over the years, financial reporting has been the most dominant way of measuring the performance of corporate organizations. ",
            "However, with the rising concern about social and environmental impacts, the global reporting initiative standards were developed to help organizations determine their sustainability (Cooney & Lynch-Cerullo, 2014, p. ",
            "367). ",
            "Although most organizations are determined to achieve true sustainability, their investment and commitment efforts do not tally their social and environmental impacts (Maier et al., p. ",
            "1805). ",
            "The organizations are not designed to achieve sustainable development but rather to make profits for the investors. ",
            "As mentioned earlier, the goal of SROI is to help organizations measure their impact on society and the environment.\n",
            "SROI is based on accounting principles that include involving stakeholders, transparency, and verifiable results. ",
            "It also requires experts to understand the changes an organization undergoes and value only things that matter(The social value network, 2012). ",
            "Lastly, one should only include material things and not over-claim them (Nicholls. ",
            "2017. ",

            "The SROI analysis is carried out in six bold steps, each achieving a given role and paving the way for the next one. ",
            "The first step identifies the organization or investment scope and the associated stakeholders. ",
            "With the help of the stakeholders, the second step encompasses pairing inputs with outputs. ",
            "This is achieved through an impact map, also known as the theory of change (Yates et al., 2017, p. ",

            "Here, organizations deduce the benefits of the investment, deduct the negative impacts, and juxtapose the results to the investment. ",
            "In this step, the actual sensitivity of the results is calculated to provide a clear picture of the value of the investment. ",
            "The last step involves sharing the findings of the report with stakeholders. ",
            "The phase is often forgotten or downplayed by most managers, challenging the essence of the whole process. ",

            "The framework measures the change resulting from company operations and affecting the well-being of its stakeholders. ",
            "In a nutshell, the framework measures the impact of the corporate on the value they add to the communities financially, socially, and environment-wise.\n",
            "Counter-Arguments Against Social Return on Investment\n",
            "ROI calculates the social impacts of investments in various ways and whose difficulty varies depending on the associated activities (Davies et al., 2019. ",
            "p. ",
            "585). ",
            "Although some activities are easily monetized, others are challenging as their functions are only comparable ordinarily. ",
            "For example, some activities can only be evaluated using cost-of-use or revealed preferences (Kalagnanam et al., 2019). ",
            "Some other social values can not be monetized, and experts find it challenging to substantial, which invalidates the entire framework (Cordes, 2017.p. ",
            "98).\n",
            "SROI is a cumbersome framework to measure aspects that cannot be monetized, like an increase in saved lives or quality of life (Ribeiro et al., 2018, p. ",
            "262). ",
            "Unlike financial analysis, experts do not agree on the kind of proxies that should be used where other reporting principles, frameworks, and standards have been well accepted (Ribeiro et al., 2018, p. ",
            "262). ",
            "It implies that organizations have to develop their standards, which might not receive general acceptance or standardization, raising questions about the applicability of the SROI framework (Then et al., 2017).\n",
            "SROI is commonly applied in non-profit organizations such as schools, churches, heritage conservation instructions, and disaster relief organizations (Bellucci et al., 2017). ",
            "Experts argue that it is challenging to establish commercial activities to be evaluated (Farr and Cressey, 2019,p. ",
            "238). ",
            "As a result, the framework fails to achieve its targeted goal in such situations. ",
            "On most occasions, it is impossible to measure the social outcome as the link between outcomes and the associated activities does not exist (Kim & Lim, 2017, p. ",
            "14). ",
            "Without a standard interval between activities and their corresponding outcomes, it becomes difficult for experts to settle on the resulting uncertainties, which invalidates the applicability of the model.\n",
            "Benefits of Social Return on Investment\n",
            "Just like any other performance and value measurement framework, SROI presents its pros and cons, which are used to determine its usefulness in a given organization, context, or situation. ",
            "Firstly, the framework provides evidence for the value of an investment in all domains: financial, social, and environmental (Saenz, 2020). ",
            "Usually, the impacts of an investment should not just be measured in terms of the financial gains, which is the case with most performance and value measurement frameworks. ",
            "In cases where the financial value for a given activity or outcome is not known, the framework employs proxies that help in the value calculations. ",
            "In the end, an organization can deduce the ideal value of an investment in a particular project in society and the environment.\n",
            "With the help of other value establishment tools, such as results-based accounting, mapping, or program logic, the social return on investment can be used to measure the value of services provided. ",
            "This implies the framework is applicable in seemingly impossible scenarios to establish the value of an investment on its financial, social, and environmental obligations. ",
            "Unlike products, services are intangible and, at times, challenging to evaluate (Jiang et al., 2019, p. ",
            "17). ",
            "The barrier is, however, overcome by the SROI performance and value measurement framework.\n",

            "33). ",
            "It also helps organizations identify essential resources, understand their applicability, and harness them to manage positive and negative risks (Chen et al., 2018, p. ",

            "With the help of the SROI tools, organizations can establish and appreciate the importance of cooperating and working with other individuals or organizations that positively impact society and the environment. ",

            "The tool also enables stakeholders to take a proactive and constructive part in service formulation and actualization design, improving the organization\u2019s reputation and value.\n",

            "SROI improves the persuasiveness of companies bidding for public and private tenders. ",

            "Social Significance of Emily Dickinson\u2019s \u201cHope Is the Thing with Feathers\u201d Essay\n",
            "In Emily Dickinson\u2019s poem \u201cHope Is the Thing with Feathers\u201d one can see the passionate, deeply feeling, masterful nature of the author. ",
            "During the years of her work, there was a Civil War between the bourgeois North and the slave-owning South of America. ",
            "Quiet Amherst, where Emily Dickinson lived, seemed to lie apart from these events, but even in it they mourned their dead sons. ",
            "This fact undoubtedly also influenced the work of Emily Dickinson, and it is in it that the social significance of the poem \u201cHope Is the Thing with Feathers\u201d is reflected.\n",
            "The poem is dominated by the vowel sound [i], the sibilant deaf consonant [s], the sonorous consonants [l], [m]. ",
            "The vowel sound [i] is associated with blue, green \u2013 these are the colors of light, joy and tranquility: \u201cI\u2019ve heard it in the chilliest land\u201d (Dickinson 1). ",
            "At the same time, the positive image of \u201cchilliest land\u201d is a metaphor which means the North struggling with the slave system. ",
            "Voiceless consonant sounds are associated with rustling, noise and dark tones: \u201csore must be the storm\u201d (Dickinson 1). ",
            "Thus, in the imagination there is a picture of the struggle of two tones, the struggle of dark and light colors (Parker 22). ",
            "This confrontation, which is present in the poem even at the phonetic level, reflects the struggle of the north and the south.\n",
            "The text of the poem alternates ascending and descending tones. ",
            "The take-off takes place in words expressing hope for the defeat of the slave-owning society (\u201cHope\u201d, \u201cAnd sweetest\u201d) (Dickinson 1). ",
            "The text ends with an ascending tone: the words \u201cof Me\u201d sound with increased emotionality (Dickinson 1). ",
            "The ascending tone is intertwined in the poem with the descending one and this conveys the ups and downs, emotions and feelings of the lyrical hero. ",
            "The alternation of ascending and descending tones in the poem conveys the mood of the struggle against the slave-owning society.\n",
            "The key images of the poem are: hope, sou1, ga1e, storm, bird, extremity. ",
            "These words characterize the relationship of the central image of the poem (\u201chope\u201d) and the lyrical hero with the surrounding world (Dickinson 1). ",
            "\u201cHope\u201d in this poem is personal, something living in the soul of a person:\n",
            "\u201cHope\u201d is the thing with feathers / That perches in the soul (Dickinson 1).\n",
            "A bird with feathers is a traditional symbol of freedom. ",
            "By adding wings to the image of hope, the author shows the significance of the outcome of a large-scale event \u2013 the war of the North with the South \u2013 for each person, for the freedom of an individual.\n",
            "Verbs that create the image of hope stand in the present tense and express the continuity of action, constancy (\u201cperches\u201d, \u201csings\u201d, \u201cnever stops\u201d) of struggle (Dickinson 1). ",
            "Since the confrontation between a slave-owning and a free society has been going on for centuries, in combination with the adverb \u201cnever\u201d, the verb indicates the constancy of action. ",
            "The key word \u201chope\u201d acquires in the text a meaning associated with constancy, thanks to which the motive of confrontation, scattered struggle is heard. ",
            "The poem uses words that indicate space, natural phenomena: \u201cga1e\u201d, \u201cstorm\u201d, \u201cstrangest sea\u201d, \u201cextremity\u201d (Dickinson 1). ",
            "These words are associated with danger, anxiety and pain. ",
            "An image of the aggressive surrounding world is created, a similar attitude is transferred to the lyrical hero, to the central image of the poem. ",
            "In this way, the atmosphere of tension that exists at the moment of the split of American society into two parts is transmitted.\n",
            "Thus, \u201cHope Is the Thing with Feathers\u201d is a socially significant poem, since the image of hope in the form of a small timid bird conveys the worldview of thousands of Americans in a difficult historical period. ",
            "Emily Dickinson managed to accurately convey the state of many citizens at a significant moment in the struggle of the North with the slave-owning South.\n",

            "In 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment faced a cyber attack from North Korea prior to the release of The Interview, a film that discusses the personality of North Korea\u2019s dictator, Kim Jong Un. ",
            "In addition to the cyberattack that caused millions of losses for the company, Sony also faced a threat from the terrorists that several theaters that will show the film will be attacked. ",
            "Sony\u2019s response to the threats included canceling the film\u2019s release and switching to video-on-demand outlets. ",
            "Some suggested that canceling the film\u2019s release creates a dangerous precedent of a large company submitting to terrorist orders. ",
            "However, while the company\u2019s solution partially allowed them to disobey the terrorists\u2019 order, it also displayed how terrorists\u2019 plans can be prevented through technological development.\n",
            "In my opinion, Sony\u2019s response was appropriate for the situation, as it could be acknowledged as the use of the opponent\u2019s weapon against him. ",
            "Therefore, while the terrorists used cyberattacks to steal the company\u2019s information and destroy their equipment, Sony switched the release to on-demand platforms and streaming services, allowing a speedy and widespread release of the film. ",
            "As on-demand videos are easier to pirate, the film\u2019s pirate copies quickly spread across the internet, making film easier to access and more discussed across different countries and segments of the population. ",
            "In addition, the film\u2019s plot turned out to be more appealing to comedy than satire, influencing the public\u2019s opinion about the earlier threats from North Korea. ",
            "In my opinion, Sony\u2019s response to the attack was appropriate for the situation and politicly addressed several concerns.\n",
            "Furthermore, while the case is complicated by presenting a real terrorist threat to the population, there are certain things that Sony and the U.S. ",
            "government could have done differently to discourage future such attacks on other U.S. ",
            "organizations. ",
            "Firstly, Sony never publicly acknowledged that The Interview is a satire that has no connection with reality and does not threaten North Korea\u2019s political regime. ",
            "Instead, it seemed that the company used unexpected publicity to market a relatively insignificant comedy film. ",
            "Therefore, by initially canceling the film\u2019s release date, the company set a negative precedent of a major company submitting to terrorist demands.\n",
            "Next, considering the government\u2019s role in Sony\u2019s case, the issue should have raised attention to the cyber security problem in both governmental structures and large business corporations. ",
            "Instead of acknowledging that the issue was Sony\u2019s problem, analyzing the breach and constructing new cyber security policies for the governmental organizations could have helped prevent other attacks in the future. ",
            "For example, it could have prevented the 2016 controversy with foreign interference in the presidential election (Stengel). ",
            "Therefore, by focusing on Sony\u2019s financial losses instead of similar potential threats in the future, the U.S. ",
            "government exposed the cyber security issues that contributed to future cyberattacks.\n",
            "In conclusion, the case of Sony\u2019s response to the cyberattack demonstrates the importance of prompt identification of the issue and its consequences. ",
            "The case also displays how a creative approach to a problem that simultaneously addresses several concerns is not always the right choice. ",
            "Furthermore, preventing both real-world terrorist violence and cyberattacks requires a collective effort of the U.S. ",
            "government and business organizations. ",
            "The possible measures include regulation of governmental and private organizations\u2019 cyber security to achieve higher data protection standards. ",
            "Through collective efforts and sufficient budgeting, organizations can develop more advanced cyber security and supervision systems and implement them in a short period of time, preventing future real-world terrorist violence and cyberattacks.\n",

            "The first half of Imitation of Life deals with the question from a feminist perspective of what it means to be a woman living in a male-dominated society, while the second half deals with how women of color are affected by racism. ",
            "Heung notes that it is a story about imitation and pretending to be untrue. ",
            "Lora Meredith, a white woman, widow, and aspiring actress, always pretends. ",
            "The motive for this behavior is to avoid the hassle of raising his only daughter, Susie, alone with very little money. ",
            "Although Lora defies stereotypes by not letting any man control her or interfere with her success, she upholds the proper standards of a good mother.\n",
            "In turn, Susie\u2019s imitation of life is how she pretends to be a daughter, receiving all the love and affection from someone other than her mother while at the same time desperately showing her love to a man whose love is unrequited. ",
            "Another heroine, Sarah Jane Johnson, spends her entire life imitating, pretending to be white when she is actually black. ",
            "Annie Johnson, Sarah Jane\u2019s mother, is a black woman who lives her life with the feeling of always seeing herself through the eyes of others.\n",
            "Thus, all these female characters are role models in their performances. ",
            "An exception is only Annie, who, although she lives under the prism of someone else\u2019s opinion, nevertheless accepts the burden of the reality of what it means to be a black woman in a world that does not accept race. ",
            "However, in the case of Lora, Susie, and Sarah Jane, authenticity is punished in a male-dominated and anti-female world.\n",
            "It is noteworthy that with her self-deception, Sarah Jane challenges the limitations of her personality and a woman\u2019s role in those times. ",
            "Refusing to be a real lady or a real black, Sarah Jane plays a series of impersonations throughout the film. ",
            "On the one hand, she matches the images of a rich musician, which she demonstrates for her white boyfriend. ",
            "On the other hand, she is a sultry singer for sleazy nightclubbers.\n",

            "Teenage Suicide and Preventive Measures Essay\n",
            "Suicide is one of the serious problems of modern society, the relevance of which is typical for countries with very different socio-economic conditions, cultural, and religious traditions. ",
            "One of the most suicidally dangerous ages is adolescence (Button and Marsh 13). ",
            "When sexual and role identification is formed, unrequited love, conflicts with friends and parents, and school problems are acutely experienced. ",
            "The prevention of suicidal behavior is one of modern society\u2019s most critical and complex problems. ",
            "Combinations of micro-social reasons and individual psychological features of the person, causing suicidal forms of reaction to psychologically difficult circumstances, assume individualization of work, especially with students at risk.\n",
            "When carrying out a conversation with the teenager thinking about suicide, teachers are recommended to take the following steps. ",
            "First, it is necessary to listen attentively to the interlocutor, as teenagers often suffer from loneliness and the impossibility of pouring out the soul. ",
            "Secondly, it is essential to formulate questions correctly, calmly, and lucidly to ask about the essence of the disturbing situation and about what help is needed. ",
            "Thirdly, it is unnecessary to argue and not insist that his misfortune is insignificant, that he lives better than others. ",
            "Teachers should not use statements that make the child feel unnecessary (Coleman 56). ",
            "Besides, it is necessary to try to give the teenager hope. ",
            "It should be realistic and aimed at strengthening his forces and abilities. ",
            "If suicidal tendencies of a schoolboy are noticed, the following tips will help to change the situation.\n",
            "The first step is to listen carefully to the teenager who has decided to commit suicide and make every effort to understand the problem behind the words. ",
            "One also needs to assess the seriousness of the child\u2019s intentions and feelings (Robinson et al. ",
            "6). ",
            "If he already has a concrete plan for suicide, he needs help right away. ",
            "At the same time, it is essential to assess the depth of the emotional crisis, paying attention to details. ",
            "For example, if the person in a state of depression suddenly starts to show violent activity \u2013 this can be a cause for alarm.\n",
            "It is worth paying attention to all, even the minor grievances and complaints. ",
            "The teenager may not give vent to his feelings, hiding his problems, but at the same time be in a state of deep depression. ",
            "To prevent a teenager from committing suicide, parents should cultivate in the child the habit of telling his parents not only about his achievements but also about his worries, doubts, and fears (Kweon 167). ",
            "In addition, one cannot sneer at the child if, in any situation, he is weak physically and mentally. ",
            "Instead, it is necessary to help and support him or her, to point out possible ways of solving the problem.\n",
            "To sum up, taking preventive measures to prevent teenage suicide is deeply individual. ",
            "Work with the teenager should be carried out both by the teacher and the parents. ",
            "It is essential to listen to the child and allow him or her to speak openly about his/her problems and anxieties. ",
            "If the teen feels that he or she has a safe place to talk openly about his or her worries, he or she is less likely to commit suicide. ",
            "When talking to depressed children, taking their concerns seriously and showing involvement and interest is essential. ",
            "Thus, if timely prophylactic measures are taken, teen suicide can be prevented.\n",

            "Tesla and the Auto Dealers Industry Essay\n",
            "Tesla had entered the automobile market forcefully and, with energetic leadership, smart marketing, and high-quality products, carved a considerable share for itself. ",
            "It inevitably puts the company at odds with other auto dealers, including the giants like Volkswagen and Toyota, who use a different retail model. ",
            "While the competition and increased supply impact the range of choices that people have positively, monopolization still remains a possibility, driven by the same sinful nature that was already recognized in biblical times.\n",
            "Overall, Tesla\u2019s entry into the automobile market impacted the situation for the better insofar as the ordinary customer is concerned. ",
            "On the one hand, it added another car manufacturer to the list of those to choose from and, therefore, increased the range of options available to the customers. ",
            "Apart from that, its emphasis on direct sales, as opposed to franchising, creates a different buying experience, which also facilitates choice.\n",
            "In terms of natural market forces, increased supply represented by Tesla\u2019s entry into the market is also a positive factor. ",
            "The dynamics of the economy ensure that, with an increased supply and roughly stable demand, the price equilibrium point will gradually move down, thus, making the goods more accessible. ",
            "In this respect, increased competition also impacts the range of choices for the better, albeit indirectly, as lower prices ensure there can be more options for the same spending level.\n",
            "That being said, the drive toward monopolization, with all its detrimental effects for the consumer, still remains. ",
            "The simplest biblical explanation for this drive is, of course, the sin of greed that drives people to obtain more than they can possibly need. ",
            "By eliminating competition and dominating the market, monopolist suppliers seek to increase their wealth at the expense of the consumers by depriving them of alternatives, which is hardly Christian.\n",
            "To summarize, Tesla\u2019s competition with traditional auto dealers impacts the range of choices positively insofar as the consumer is concerned. ",
            "Increased supply and competition ensure that, at least theoretically, there should be more options available. ",
            "Still, there is no doubt that any large company in the industry would favor the opportunity to monopolize the market by eliminating competition to satisfy its greed.\n",
            "The person I interviewed for this assignment was my mother, a pious and conservative christen woman. ",
            "She does not have that much interest in the automobile market, and her answers were largely influenced by the common sense perspective on the matter. ",
            "She posited that the entry of a new company into the market is generally good because it would give people more choice options. ",
            "She did not have much to say about the natural market forces shaping the supply-demand mechanics in the automobile market but assumed that competition was good as long as the companies competed honestly. ",
            "She even quoted Proverbs 1:11 \u2013 \u201cThe Lord detests dishonest scales, but the accurate weights find favor with him.\u201d That was the way of expressing her distaste for the dishonest and corrupt competition practices.\n",
            "Speaking of the desire to monopolize the market and eliminate competition, she likened it to the Pharaoh lending grain to the Jews, as described in Genesis 47. ",
            "From her perspective, it is not mere greed that drives the desire toward monopolization but the lust for power and control. ",
            "According to her, creating a situation when people cannot choose and only buy from a single supplier means making servants of people, like the Pharaoh would make servants of Jacob\u2019s sons, if not for Joseph.\n"

            "The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a work about how people perceive life and reality. ",
            "Many people in today\u2019s environment have a distorted perception of reality. ",
            "Plato\u2019s work is important and vital because it underlines the significance of reconfiguring oneself in order to discover the truth. ",
            "Using extensive metaphors, powerful connotative language, and an elegant questioning tone, he furthers this purpose. ",
            "Through distinctive rhetoric, Plato highlights his unique perspective on reality.\n",
            "First of all, Plato created the people in the cave captives in order to rhetorically appeal to the audience\u2019s emotions and arouse the sensations that already exist in them, which, of course, already produces an intimidating image in the reader\u2019s mind. ",
            "Furthermore, the inmates symbolize all of the people who are confined, allowing viewers to realize that they may interact with the inmates and make them unhappy at the fact that they are genuinely stuck. ",
            "Plato\u2019s shackles elicit feelings of rage and despair in the reader by conjuring up vivid and terrible pictures in the reader\u2019s imagination. ",
            "He uses extensive rhetoric to visualize the scenes of the prisoners inside the cave, mainly the metaphors.\n",
            "Plato skillfully conveys rhetorical devices to support his point of view that individuals are frequently so oblivious to the knowledge that is freely offered to them that they lose out on the opportunity to acquire a new degree of understanding about reality. ",
            "The Allegory of the Cave employs a number of metaphors to emphasize its point, as well as symbols to connect one notion to another. ",
            "A cave with inmates confined within, for example, illustrates how our knowledge is cloaked in darkness, much like a cave in real life (Plato). ",
            "He is caught in this misconception of the world, much as being in a dark, confined place precludes a person from perceiving the actual world.\n",
            "The light was also used as a metaphor for a person\u2019s ability to perceive the truth. ",
            "Finally, the philosopher is represented by the escaping prisoner. ",
            "Philosophers are interested in learning more about the world, they are seeking anything outside the cave (Plato). ",
            "Plato\u2019s rhetorical methods, which finally lead to the successful representation of his vision, include metaphors and symbols, which are unquestionably crucial.\n",
            "To express his argument, Plato also used the rhetorical method of rhetorical questions. ",
            "Throughout the essay, the author asks rhetorical questions. ",
            "In fact, there is at least one rhetorical question in practically every paragraph or section. ",
            "\u201c\u2026Do you not expect that he would felicitate himself on the change and pitied it?\u201d \u2013 Plato asks hypothetical questions to illustrate his points (Plato). ",

            "The music in the film plays a vital role as in every crucial point of the movie, the song starts. ",

            "The Battle of Alma, 20 September 1854 Research Paper\n",
            "The Crimean War of 1853-56 was the first major military conflict in Europe since the Napoleonic Wars and, as such, often attracted historians\u2019 attention. ",
            "Fought between Russia and a coalition of European powers together with the Ottoman Empire, the conflict demonstrated considerable advances in technology, communication, and the art of war. ",
            "As the name suggests, an important part of the conflict was the campaign fought in the Crimean peninsula between the defending Russians and the expeditionary force of British, French, Ottoman, and later Sardinian troops. ",
            "The most famous events of the war, such as the Charge of the Light Brigade, were associated with the siege of the Russian naval base in Sevastopol. ",
            "However, this siege would have been impossible if not for the allied victory in the first major battle of the Crimean campaign. ",
            "The battle of Alma, fought on 20 September 1854, opened the road to Sevastopol and proved the superiority of the allied arms and the French tactics over the cumbersome Russian military.\n",
            "Before delving into the battle itself, it is necessary to briefly cover its context. ",
            "In 1852-1853 a seemingly trite dispute between the Orthodox and Catholic clergy in Palestine escalated into a diplomatic conflict between Russia and France (Tate 15). ",
            "Alarmed by the Russian propositions to partition the Ottoman Empire, Britain began drifting closer to the French side. ",
            "After the Ottoman Empire refused the ultimatum that would give Russia the right to intervene in its internal affairs on Christians\u2019 behalf, war broke out in October 1853. ",
            "Russia engaged the Ottomans on the Danube and in the Caucasus, but with no decisive result, and was soon forced to abandon the latter theater due to Austrian intervention. ",
            "Unwilling to see Russia upsetting the balance in both Europe and the Middle East, Britain and France began mobilizing and declared war on Russia in March 1854 (Tate 18). ",
            "A combined French-British force arrived in Bulgaria and then, reinforced by some Ottoman troops, launched an expedition against Sevastopol, a major Russian naval base. ",
            "After disembarking in Crimea on September 4, they marched toward their goal and soon encountered the Russian army waiting for them.\n",
            "The Russian force, up to 40,000 string and led by Prince Menshikov, an experienced veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, occupied a good defensive position between the allies and Sevastopol. ",
            "The river Alma was not particularly deep but still constituted an obstacle, and its steep left bank, which was occupied by the Russians, made it even stronger (Baumgart 128). ",
            "However, the Russian commander believed that the river slopes on his left flank were nigh impassable and only left a token force at this point (Baumgart 128). ",
            "The allied force, up to 61,000, would have to cross the shallow river under the Russian fire and then scale the steep hills beyond. ",
            "However, the French general Saint-Arnaud, who also held overall command of the allied army, noted what he saw as Menshikov\u2019s fatal mistake. ",
            "A veteran of the colonial war in Algiers, he considered the hills on the left Russian flank perfectly accessible for his hardened troops and decided to turn the Russian flank there (Baumgart 128). ",
            "As for the British commander Lord Raglan, he was charged with attacking and tying up the Russian right flank while the French did their part.\n",
            "Tactically speaking, each of the three armies represented a fairly different picture. ",
            "The French, especially the light infantry called Zuaves, utilized their Algerian experience and fought in loose skirmish lines to maximize the effect of their rifles while lowering their own casualties (Baumgart 129). ",
            "The British, still clinging to the tactics of Wellington\u2019s times, marched forward in lines, which could deliver devastating volleys against dense formations but were also quite vulnerable to the enemy fire (Gowing). ",
            "As for the Russians, they also used the tactics that served them well in the Napoleonic Wars and mostly fought and maneuvered in battalion columns (Baumgart 68). ",
            "While fearsome in bayonet charges, these columns provided an easy target for the enemy fire. ",
            "The majority of the allied infantry were all armed with modern rifles with an effective range of 500-600 meters, while outdated Russian smoothbores could not fire accurately beyond 250 meters (Baumgart 68). ",
            "Artillery pieces were roughly comparable in all armies and fired solid shot on the distance of up to 3-4 kilometers and canister up to 600 meters, although the accuracy decreased dramatically with range.\n",
            "The battle began in the morning of September 20, with the four divisions of the French army advancing against the Russian left flank and center. ",
            "As mentioned above, the Russians thought their left to be inaccessible and overlooked it, leaving only a single battalion there (Baumgart 128). ",
            "The French light infantry proved this estimation wrong, climbing the steep slopes by entire battalions and even dragging field guns up (Baumgart 129). ",
            "Although Menshikov understood the threat and dispatched his reserves to the left, it was too late. ",
            "Although the Russian artillery fired well and inflicted casualties upon the advancing French, its canister \u2013 the only effective type of round against infantry \u2013 had roughly the same range as the French rifles (Baumgart 129). ",
            "It allowed the French sharpshooters to kill the gunners quickly, and after that, the cumbersome Russian columns with their outdated smoothbores were easy to engage from the safe range. ",
            "Thus, utilizing their superior tactics and weaponry, the French decimated the Russian forces that opposed them and progressed forward. ",
            "This movement turned the Russians\u2019 flank and threatened their center, which was already engaging the other half of the French army.\n",
            "The British, who advanced against the Russian right flank, faced more difficulty than their French counterparts. ",
            "While the Russian position there was more accessible, the Russians have erected field fortifications protecting their guns from enemy fire. ",
            "As the British lines advanced, Russian guns inflicted progressively heavier casualties upon them. ",
            "The fire was so intense that a British soldier who fought in the battle referred to it as a \u201churricane of shot and shell\u201d (Gowing). ",
            "Despite considerable casualties, the first British line managed to assault the Russian positions and take the guns. ",
            "However, the Russian infantry counterattacked almost immediately and drove them away from the artillery positions with a fierce bayonet charge. ",
            "According to the eyewitness, the British \u201clost a great number of our men and, by overwhelming numbers\u2026 were mobbed out of the battery\u201d (Gowing). ",
            "However, the Russian overextended their counterattack and ran directly into the murderous volley fire of the second British line. ",
            "After that, the British troops renewed the offensive and engaged the Russians in heavy fighting that lasted until the French pressure on its left flank and center forced the Russian army to retreat.\n",
            "Seeing his left flank turned and his right flank and center pushed, Menshikov decided to retreat. ",
            "The allies did not attempt to pursue the Russians \u2013 a decision that owed as much to fatigue and scorching heat as to the Russian superiority in cavalry and unknown terrain (Baumgart 130). ",
            "The Russian casualties were fairly heavy in proportion to the number of troops engaged and amounted to approximately 1800 dead, 3900 wounded, and 700 missing or taken prisoner (Baumgart 131). ",
            "The British lost up to 300 dead and around 2000 wounded, while the French losses were between 140 and 250 dead and 1200-1400 wounded (Baumgart 131). ",
            "Put together, these figures highlight the superiority of the French tactics and especially the skirmish lines, which made the infantry less vulnerable to massed enemy fire than the Russian columns of British lines. ",
            "They also demonstrate the superiority of rifles as compared to smoothbores used by most of the Russian infantry. ",
            "The allied victory opened the road to Sevastopol, the siege of which would last for almost a year and constitute the most important part of the Crimean War.\n",
            "As one can see, the battle of the Alma River was an important engagement that demonstrated the superiority of the French and, to a much lesser degree, British forces. ",
            "Antiquated tactics and outdated smoothbore muskets of the Russian army proved no match to the French assault. ",
            "The British tactics were just as cumbersome as the Russian, but the redcoats benefited from having rifles with greater effective range. ",
            "The decisive factor in winning the battle was Saint-Arnaud\u2019s tactical skills that allowed him to correctly identify the weak point of Russian defenses and turn the left Russian flank. ",
            "The battle of the Alma was not only a tactical but also a strategic and psychological success, as it opened the way to Sevastopol and instilled the allied troops with a sense of superiority.\n",

            "The existence and proper functioning of democracy are particularly dependent on the ability of the society to connect and interact within its communities to resolve tentative issues. ",
            "The author of the article \u201cBowling Alone: America\u2019s Declining Social Capital\u201d discusses and analyzes the manifestations of the civic society of the United States of America by assessing its change. ",
            "Civic society as an expression of democracy has its social capital, which is characterized by the formation of social networks between people. ",
            "The quality of such connections allows for timely and effective resolution of problematic issues due to the continuous awareness and interaction of the involved individuals within the community. ",
            "Indeed, Putnam states that \u201csuch networks facilitate coordination and communication, amplify reputations, and thus allow dilemmas of collective action to be resolved\u201d (66). ",
            "Thus, in general, civic societies that form networks are capable of facilitating the functioning of a democratic society.\n",
            "However, the ongoing trends in American society indicate a negative change in the readiness of people to engage in social networks and interact with others for social problem resolution. ",
            "Within the past decades, the number of clubs, organizational associations, unities, religious networks, and other forms of civic engagement has significantly reduced. ",
            "One of the reasons for such a deterioration in social capital is the development in people\u2019s mobility and homeownership, which implies moving frequently and the lack of necessity to form strong social bonds. ",
            "According to Putnam, \u201cmobility, like frequent re-potting of plants, tends to disrupt root systems, and it takes time for an uprooted individual to put down new roots\u201d (72). ",

            "The case of Bridgestone vs. ",
            "IBM presents an example that displays the importance of communication in cooperation between businesses. ",
            "In brief, the American subsidiary of Bridgestone requested IBM to develop an extensive business system that will be capable of processing a large volume of orders. ",
            "Due to several complications, the system developed by IBM was released behind schedule yet way earlier than the last steps of development, which resulted in millions of financial losses and the deterioration of both companies\u2019 images. ",
            "Analyzing the details of the case provides an understanding of common complications in significant projects and how improper execution of extensive projects can influence the reputation of collaborating companies.\n",
            "First, in defining what each side could do differently to improve the outcomes, one could notice immediately that both companies had issues hindering their work and left them undiscussed. ",
            "IBM had trouble working with a project already attempted several times by other vendors, which caused additional obstacles not previously discussed by the management. ",
            "The obstacles resulted in delays in system release, and due to a lack of understanding in communication, Bridgestone proceeded with the release of the unfinished system. ",
            "The simplest solution for Bridgestone that could have sufficiently improved the outcomes, in this case, was to postpone the release and give IBM time to finish the system. ",
            "While delaying the system release could have resulted in additional expenses, the order data could have been saved without any threats to the existing customer base. ",
            "Moreover, it seems that IBM insisted on running a testing launch of the system. ",
            "Therefore, the adverse outcomes could have been prevented if Bridgestone did not fail to process the vendor\u2019s request and was not excessively focused on improving the existing system in a short time.\n",
            "Next, there is a significant difference in the harm that publicity around this project caused to the two companies. ",
            "On the one hand, Bridgestone lost a substantial portion of customers, business partners, and brand supporters. ",
            "Moreover, the company seemingly suffered crucial financial damage from unsuccessful system implementation, while the development of the system was out of Bridgestone\u2019s competence. ",
            "Thus, Bridgestone suffered more losses from the project\u2019s failure than IBM. ",
            "However, IBM\u2019s image was more harmed by the event\u2019s publicity when Bridgestone filed a suit against IBM. ",
            "In addition to being charged in breach of contract, Bridgestone company accused IBM of fraud as IBM\u2019s budget for developing the system exceeded Bridgestone\u2019s initial budget. ",
            "Furthermore, Bridgestone accused IBM of assigning incompetent personnel that lacked the necessary skills and experience to execute the project. ",
            "Therefore, even though the early launch of the system was Bridgestone\u2019s mistake, IBM\u2019s reputation as a vendor who failed to fulfill its functions was harmed more by the event\u2019s publicity.\n",
            "Lastly, considering the scale of the conflict between the two companies, it is surprising that both companies came to a mutual decision several years later. ",
            "One week prior to jury selection in 2018, both companies decided to drop their claims, even though it was unclear whether any \u201cmonetary concessions\u201d from the firms took place in the decision (Belden). ",
            "In addition, both companies filed a motion with prejudice, which means that their decision is permanent and the lawsuit cannot be raised in the future. ",
            "Therefore, it appears that in accepting their mistakes, the companies approached dealing with the negative consequences of the failed project with a more understanding approach than in the time of the system development.\n",

            "There are several reasons for perpetration, presented by the offenders. ",
            "The first is alert opportunism, which means that offenders did not intend to engage in cart theft, yet they recognized an easy opportunity. ",
            "Such actions are not pre-planned, require minimal effort and have low risk. ",
            "An important feature of alert opportunism is the responsibility of car owners, who fail to ensure basic security measures. ",
            "Alert opportunism also does not imply that perpetrators were not planning to commit any crime at all. ",
            "It is entirely possible that a person with the intent of burglary found keys and took advantage of them.\n",
            "Another reason, which leads to auto theft, is active search. ",
            "Unlike alert opportunists, who were not planning on stealing initially, active search presupposes criminal intent in the beginning. ",
            "It should also be noted that car owners are once again responsible for presenting offenders with a theft opportunity. ",
            "Active searchers seek open cars with keys left in them. ",
            "Offenders also use people\u2019s lack of caution to their advantage, by searching in highly populated areas and in places where alcohol drinking is rampant. ",
            "In some cases, it is easier for offenders to wait until an opportunity arises, once again taking advantage of people\u2019s carelessness. ",
            "Some active searchers employ a more direct approach, such as infiltrating homes with the express intent of stealing car keys.\n",
            "Both active searchers and alert opportunists avoid meeting car owners. ",
            "However, there is a different strategy, which presupposes establishing contact with the owner. ",
            "One way to obtain keys is to threaten owners with weapons. ",
            "Another method is to use substances, which prevent victims from resisting a carjacking attempt. ",
            "In both cases, a perpetrator meets a car owner and obtains keys from them with the use of objects that put victims\u2019 lives at risk.\n",
            "There are various reasons for the offenders\u2019 decision to engage in a carjacking. ",
            "Sometimes, perpetrators are not skilled enough at stealing cars, which propels them to use force to obtain keys. ",
            "Carjacking may also be the result of alert opportunism when offenders resort to presented carjacking opportunities while committing other crimes. ",
            "Naturally, some offenders purposely seek an owner with the desired car, physically confront them and obtain keys by force. ",
            "Such an approach is an example of an active search for carjackers.\n",
            "However, meeting a car owner does not necessarily presuppose carjacking. ",
            "Some offenders use manipulation techniques to persuade car owners to allow them in the vicinity of keys. ",
            "It is important to understand that manipulation requires substantial preparation on the perpetrator\u2019s end. ",
            "In some cases, manipulators replace real keys with forged ones, which is initially unnoticed by owners. ",
            "In other situations, offenders use clay to make a mould of keys. ",
            "However, sometimes, manipulators convince owners into actually giving them keys or leaving the offender alone in a vehicle with keys in it. ",
            "In all cases, manipulators use conversation techniques to keep a victim distracted and unsuspecting of a potential crime.\n",
            "Keys are essential in starting a car, but obtaining one particular set of keys may not actually be necessary to do. ",
            "There are keys that fit different models, which are known as master keys. ",
            "These keys are obtained from official car dealerships under the pretext of accidentally locking a car with keys inside. ",
            "Master keys are subsequently copied and distributed among other offenders. ",
            "Another way of creating a set of master keys is by modifying an existing car key. ",
            "Although using master keys is primarily limited to some cars manufactured in the 1900s, it does substantially facilitate car theft.\n",
            "Historically, the most preferred way of auto theft prevention the is mechanical improvement of security of cars. ",
            "As vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, so does the task of stealing them. ",
            "Offenders\u2019 strategy is now directed at obtaining car keys, which will allow them access to the vehicles. ",
            "As a result, not only is the problem of auto theft not resolved, but it continues to be a serious public issue. ",
            "It can even be stated that vehicle hardening may have actually propelled offenders to learn and become better at techniques allowing them to obtain car keys.\n",
            "The analysis of offenders who engage in car theft shows that opportunism does not account for all car-related crimes. ",
            "While many offenders do take advantage of the opportunities presented by the carelessness of car owners, many of them are actually motivated to actively seek car owners. ",
            "These perpetrators are rational in their perception of the challenges behind a car theft. ",
            "Many of them are willing to learn and master advanced skills of manipulation and carjacking. ",
            "At the same time, carjacking may also be performed by unskilled offenders, who use direct force to obtain keys. ",
            "In all cases, increased mechanical security of cars is successfully bypassed.\n",
            "In essence, the efforts of social campaigns, which encourage car owners to remember to lock cars, have been rendered meaningless by the criminal shift towards obtaining car keys. ",
            "It is therefore imperative to reevaluate car theft prevention strategies. ",
            "The attention should be focused on the security of car keys and their spares. ",
            "The better owners can protect them, the more difficult it will be for perpetrators to obtain them.\n",
            "This advice is also applicable to commercial car dealerships, who regularly fail to identify perpetrators. ",
            "Many offenders appear to be customers, while in reality, they are criminals who take advantage of salespeople\u2019s carelessness. ",
            "Ultimately, it is up to key owners to minimize the risk of key theft. ",
            "It is entirely reasonable to suggest that without the negligence of regular people, many car thefts would not occur precisely because the potential offenders would not spot an easy opportunity. ",
            "Considering the allure of easy rewards, it is essential to minimize the possibility of such circumstances.\n"

            "In general, the business case for the Centers for Diabetes appears to be positive since the project is closely aligned with the needs of the community and the targets set by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). ",
            "However, there are potential risks, as outlined in detail in the SWOT analysis, which has to be considered before the final decision is made. ",
            "This note will detail the risks for the Centers for Diabetes and propose potential ways of mitigating them.\n",
            "First and foremost, the idea of a community health center that addresses the community health needs is closely aligned with the value-based care and the community focus that are the targets set by ACA. ",
            "Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Healthy People 2030 report cites the need to focus on how health issues are managed from a community perspective and not an individual perspective. ",
            "Hence, there is a threat of other healthcare facilities that receive reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid in the county choosing to create a similar initiative. ",
            "This is because diabetes is a common problem in the United States, affecting 10% of the general population and 14% of the Hispanic and African-American community.\n",
            "The only way to mitigate this risk is to begin marketing and outreach activities as soon as the project is approved and there is funding to support the further stages of operations. ",
            "In this way, the community will become familiarized with the hospital and the Center, and even if other similar initiatives arise, this Center will already have an established brand image, which can guarantee that it will also have visitors.\n",
            "The second significant issue identified in the report is the financial statements, since based on the assessments, the reimbursements, revenue, and grant funding will be insufficient to cover the costs of staffing and operations. ",
            "Hence, there is a need to either add services that can be reimbursed under ACA or obtain an additional source of funding. ",
            "Alternatively, there can be an option for cutting the costs, for example, having fewer community workers or reducing the expenditures associated with traveling to help ensure that the funds that this Center will have been covering these expenses. ",
            "However, it is a better option to request additional grant funding as it is vital to make certain that this Center addresses the health education needs of the community in a quality manner. ",
            "Another alternative to obtain additional funding would be to request help from the hospital, as the community center helps reduce the number of complications and, therefore, expenditures needed to care for the patients with diabetes. ",
            "Moreover, the hospital can refer its patients to the health center to advocate for their health education and self-care, and in return, support the operations of this facility.\n",
            "In summary, this note identifies the potential risks that the Center for Diabetes may face. ",
            "The two main concerns that should be considered before the launch of the Center for Diabetes are the potential threat of other community initiatives addressing the same health disparity. ",
            "This issue can be resolved through early outreach and marketing. ",
            "The second problem is the funding issue, as the financial statements make it clear that the revenue and grant will not be enough to cover the operational costs. ",
            "Hence, the Center has an option of additional services, requesting additional grants, or asking for support from the hospital.\n"

            "At the moment, AIDS is becoming quite widespread, despite all the preventive and familiarization measures carried out in educational institutions. ",
            "Thus, in order to improve the situation, college administrations are introducing various measures to combat the problem. ",
            "The educational organization, Camden County College decided to install dispensers with condoms in the toilets. ",
            "Henceforth, this work aims to prove that condom dispensers are an effective measure to lower the incidence of AIDS in adolescents, increase the credibility of college and develop sexual education and awareness.\n",
            "Therefore, as already mentioned, Camden County College decided to install special dispensers in the toilets of the educational organization. ",
            "The main problem was the ambiguity of opinions about this decision. ",
            "However, this work believes that this initiative can play a positive role in changing the dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS. ",
            "At the moment, it is noted that the age of sexual activity is significantly reduced. ",
            "Research shows that \u201cin a nationally representative survey of college students, only 58% of sexually active students reported condom use at last vaginal intercourse\u201d (The Condom Dispenser Initiative para. ",
            "1). ",
            "Further, one of the sources indicated that \u201cThe contributing factors are the cost, lack of convenient access, social norms, and lack of knowledge on how to use a condom effectively\u201d (Turner 2). ",
            "These indicators are disappointing since, at the same time, the risk of contracting a dangerous disease increases. ",
            "Moreover, feelings of shame or lack of money can also influence the decision of young people to neglect contraceptives.\n",
            "Limited access to protective equipment such as condoms is the most important obstacle in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases in young people. ",
            "Hence, when installing dispensers, the incidence rate can significantly improve since it directly affects the issue. ",
            "Every young person cannot worry about buying a contraceptive measure. ",
            "Particular influence in this process should be paid attention to the aspect that the introduction and improvement of sexual education are crucial. ",
            "It is vital to instill in students the importance of following the rules of contraception and how important it is not to have promiscuous sexual relations. ",
            "This will allow a positive response to the installation of dispensers with condoms in the toilet. ",
            "An equally important role is played by the social factor, which can hinder the success of the introduction of dispensers in condoms. ",
            "This may be met with contempt or vice versa with abuse of the opportunity provided.\n",
            "In addition, it will contribute to maintaining organization in this process, where students rationally and responsibly use the resources provided by the college. ",
            "Thus, when introducing awareness about sexual education and the importance of observing AIDS-related preventive measures, college students will treat the installation of dispensers as vending machines. ",
            "Therefore, the almost animal instinct that leads to a wrong attitude to initiative and ridicule will be absent.\n",
            "In conclusion, this work was engaged in the study of the effectiveness of the installation of dispensers with condoms at Camden County College. ",
            "The main argument given for this measure is the reduction of cases of infection with AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. ",
            "Moreover, it will contribute to strengthening the credibility of the educational organization and the development of sexual education in it. ",
            "In addition, the argument supporting the initiative implies an increase in the availability of contraceptive measures for young people, who sometimes do not have the opportunity to purchase them on their own.\n",

            "The main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses is reflected in the havoc that this pandemic has caused to the global supply chains. ",
            "Mainly, many suppliers could not produce goods for a while due to safety restrictions. ",
            "Others could not deliver them due to overloaded ports, extremely high freight rates, and displaced shipping containers, among other issues. ",
            "Although the pandemic\u2019s effect had lessened over the last year when the vaccines were introduced and people were allowed to leave their homes, the effect of this global catastrophe on the supply chains prevails.\n",
            "The most significant impact of the pandemic and the changes within the business environments are seen with small businesses. ",
            "This can be seen in the example of Amazon\u2019s growth, which was picked during the beginning of the pandemic. ",
            "As people were ordered by their governments to stay at home, the majority of consumers chose online shopping to satisfy their needs. ",
            "Hence, the customers ordered most of their items online, including groceries, clothes, personal items, and other things. ",
            "Amazon was thriving with its ability to deliver goods through its developed system of supply chains, while small brick-and-mortar stores were forced to close because they could not sustain not having profits for months. ",
            "Moreover, these small businesses did not have the finances to invest in establishing websites and delivery services. ",
            "Apart from this, Amazon has been accused of using data from its small suppliers to popular copycat items and selling them under Amazon\u2019s brand. ",
            "Hence, the internet retail giant has the resources and capabilities to overshadow any small business, which makes the competitive environment very challenging for small businesses, even in the post-pandemic times.\n",
            "Evidently, the lack of the company\u2019s ability to get goods from suppliers has become one of the major threats to the business\u2019s growth and development. ",
            "Hence, in the post-pandemic time, executives will have to rethink the role of supply chains in their strategic plans and dedicate more attention to creating supply chains that are effective. ",
            "Moreover, even when the freight rates reduce to their previous levels, the executives might want to rethink where they purchase their goods and choose local suppliers over the ones in China or developing states. ",
            "This option would be safer in the case of another disruption, and considering the ongoing issues with shipments that companies currently experience, the higher cost of local suppliers can now become comparable to the low cost of production overseas combined with high shipping rates.\n",
            "I think these changes in the supply chain\u2019s nature and consumer behaviors will be permanent, and businesses should restructure themselves to prepare for the new challenges. ",
            "Mainly, over the two years that the pandemic has been active, consumers have gotten used to purchasing items mostly online. ",
            "This is both convenient and allows one to save time and effort, and it is unlikely that consumers will revert to offline shopping when all of the restrictions are lifted. ",
            "As for companies, many executives had to find ways to support their operations when the supply chains were disrupted. ",
            "These new approaches allowed businesses to thrive during the pandemic, and it is possible that these business models will continue to be used in the future. ",
            "Therefore, the changes in the business environment caused by the pandemic will most likely prevail in the future.\n"

            "Shown above is a schematic of the electron transport chain (ETC) in a typical animal cell. ",
            "NADH (not shown) donates electrons to Flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and FADH 2 donates electrons to an iron-sulfur complex (FeS), which donates them to ubiquinone (Q).\n",
            "How does transfer of electrons from one carrier to another in the ETC generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane?\n",
            "Electron transport along the transport chain is associated with a redistribution of charges in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in excess or insufficient potential locally in certain areas. ",
            "Protons tend to make up for the insufficient potential, so they will migrate to places of decreased charge or move away from places of increased charge.\n",
            "There are poisons that can specifically block or hinder either FMN or the Fe-S in complex II that accepts electrons from FADH 2 . ",
            "Which poison (against FMN, or against the Fe-S in complex II) will have a more detrimental effect on the proton gradient, and why?\n",
            "FMNH2 poisoning is expected to have a more deleterious effect on the proton gradient because one of the primary chains of electron migration within the membrane is disrupted in this case. ",
            "In addition, FMNH2 is involved in the release of protons involved in migration through ATP synthase, so disabling FMNH2 would result in the loss of this proton action to a greater extent.\n",
            "Would the poisons described above increase oxygen consumption, decrease it, or have no effect? ",
            "Explain.\n",
            "Oxygen consumption occurs in one of the last phases, particularly in complex IV. ",
            "The poisoning of any of the phases from the previous assignment will affect electron migration, rendering the action of complex IV ineffective. ",
            "This will be realized as a cascade reaction in which the problem occurred long before the oxygen use site.\n",
            "Which electrons have more energy\u2014those accepted by Q, or those accepted by cytochrome c (Cyt c), and how do you know?\n",
            "Q takes electrons (two pieces) from the first complex and two electrons from the second complex; the total is four. ",
            "Cyt c takes only two electrons from the third complex. ",
            "Therefore, we can assume that Q has cumulatively higher energy than Cyt c.\n",
            "From which, and into which cell compartments are electrons pumped during electron transport in cell respiration?\n",
            "Q receives electrons from FMNH2 and FAD(II) and gives them to QH2, after which they migrate to complex (III), whereas Cyt C receives electrons from complex III and gives them to complex IV.\n",
            "What would be the effect on ATP production of decreasing the pH inside the mitochondrial matrix? ",
            "Explain.\n",
            "If the intramitochondrial matrix decreases its level of acidity, this will lead to a reduction in the number of free protons inside. ",

            "The End and the Beginning and Hitler\u2019s First Photograph by Wis\u0142awa Szymborska are two poems that share thematic elements concerned with time, war, and the invisibility of evil. ",
            "The poems will be analyzed and contrasted with the central theme and each other. ",
            "The thesis of this work suggests that both works by Szymborska illuminate the duality of time, both as reciting historical patterns with ease, such as the aftermath of war, and being completely untelling of events to come, such as the transformation of an innocent baby into a mass murderer.\n",
            "The End and the Beginning by Szymborska recounts the reconstruction of affected areas after a war. ",
            "The particular imagery refers to the effects of the Second World War, the pushing of rubble, the collection of corpses, and miring in sofa springs and glass. ",
            "However, the poem begins with \u201cafter every war, someone has to clean up\u201d (Szymborska, lines 1-2), which is the focal point of the poem. ",
            "Wars exist within a universal timeline as outlined by Szymborska. ",
            "She illuminates a process in which the war demolishes nations, the press and media become disinterested at its end, and as rebuilding begins, the nation becomes populated with individuals who knew little or nothing of the war (Szymborska, lines 1-4). ",
            "Here Szymborska refers to the generations that will inhabit the heritage which they did not live (lines 39-42). ",
            "Birth and innocence become a prevalent theme at the end of the poem and will be especially vital in understanding the thematic analysis of both works by the author.\n",
            "The second poem, also by Szymborska, Hitler\u2019s First Photograph , provides various imagery of Hitler as a newborn and is heavily contrasted by allusions to his future as a dictator and contributor to a genocide. ",
            "The poem suggests uncertainty through statements that wonder if Hitler could have been a doctor, priest, or worked at the Opera House in Vienna (Szymborska, lines 3-7). ",
            "Only his present as a child is known in the poem that creates an illusion of the past. ",
            "Hitler as a newborn is referred to as a little boy with teensy hands, a little angel, and a lucky fortune. ",
            "Szymborska recalls how no omen of death or signs of the future prior to his birth were visible (line 13), which supports her thesis that no person is born evil. ",
            "The normalcy of Hitler\u2019s youth is supported through images of him being alike with other children in family albums and prone to regular child-like behaviors of crying when waiting too long for the photographer to take a picture.\n",
            "The works share a number of stylistic similarities, which can be assumed as they are both written by Szymborska. ",
            "However, there are also stark differences, especially in the purpose of her using certain written elements such as metaphors, allusions, and imagery. ",
            "Metaphors are prevalent throughout both works, with The End and the Beginning hosting rough, melancholic, and foreboding symbols while Hitler\u2019s First Photograph provides symbolic features that are almost exclusively associated with innocence and goodness. ",
            "In The End and the Beginning , the most prominent images include the reference through collapsing walls, broken windows, and missing doors. ",
            "These elements are not explicitly stated but are fostered in the mind of the reader when Szymborska states that someone must prop up the walls, glaze the windows, and hang doors. ",
            "Szymborska gives physical form to a mental concept of opinion by describing that \u201csometimes someone still unearths, rusted-out arguments and carries them to the garbage pile.\u201d (lines 36-37). ",
            "The closing images of the poem allude to the new generations, free of the experiences of the war and with a \u201cblade of grass in his mouth, gazing at the clouds.\u201d (Szymborska, lines 47-48).\n",
            "Hitler\u2019s First Photograph , on the other hand, is totally involved in the past. ",
            "The language of the poem refers to the hypothesis of future events and questions, inquiring where will baby Hitler wander and who he will be. ",
            "He is constantly referred to by affectionate names such as honeybun, sugar, and mommy\u2019s sunshine (Szymborska, line 11). ",
            "These elements work to form irony, as Hitler\u2019s future events worked to defy all these early assumptions. ",
            "Here Szymborska hints at the impossibility of tacking potential evil, as someone who once seemed like an angel had killed millions in his later life. ",
            "His birth is accompanied by images of geraniums, organ music, doves seen in dreams as agents of good news, and rosy paper. ",
            "Szymborska makes subtle allusions to the irony of these metaphors, by reminding the reader that \u201cno one hears howling dogs, or fate\u2019s footsteps\u201d (line 31) not as a signal of unawareness of those around him, but at the unattainability of predicting evil.\n",
            "While both works seem to offer conflicting metaphors and images and refer to the future and past respectively, an argument can be made that they have an identical underlying thesis. ",
            "Both poems are deeply associated with the passage of time, both from the perspective of the past and present. ",
            "Essentially, the passage of time is able to teach both undeniable lessons and confirm nothing with a certain probability. ",
            "Szymborska almost states that the future is entirely predictable and totally unknown in the same frame. ",
            "War has always proceeded in the same manner and has left patterns of the aftermath. ",
            "Conflict breeds destruction and chaos, those that have survived rebuild and make room for future generations. ",
            "Szymborska hints that those that do not know war have a higher propensity to begin or fall into another. ",
            "As such, the cycle becomes familiar and possibly endless. ",
            "Alternatively, time does not allow for the attainment of certain knowledge. ",
            "Unlike war being a precursor for reconstruction, the birth of a future dictator comes with no warning. ",

            "The End of the Sula Novel by Toni Morrison Essay\n",
            "Sula is a novel by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, written in 1973. ",
            "It is an African American literary fiction that reveals deep concepts of love, morality, and moral principles. ",
            "The novel has some symbolic elements through which the author reveals one\u2019s outlook on life. ",
            "A characteristic feature of the novel is duality in some aspects; for example, some die from drowning and some from a fire. ",
            "Due to such techniques, Toni Morrison was able to accomplish the novel\u2019s purpose of conveying the duality of the world. ",
            "The double structure of the novel, along with its end, symbolizes the optimistic aspect due to the representation of sincerity, important values of life, and the deep meaning of the \u201ccircles of sorrow\u201d.\n",
            "One may notice the representation of the duality of the world, namely good and evil, and at the end of the novel, despite all the previous events, the sincere impulse of Sula\u2019s friend formulates a culmination. ",
            "Thus, one may notice a strong Nel\u2019s reaction: \u201cIt was a fine cry\u2014loud and long\u2014but it had no bottom, and it had no top, just circles and circles of sorrow\u201d (Morrison, 79). ",
            "Namely, this event implies Nel\u2019s duality of emotions, since all the time, the hero seemed to miss Jude, Nel\u2019s husband. ",
            "However, in a burst of sincere sadness at the end of the novel, Nel realizes that the melancholy is caused by the time spent without Sula. ",
            "Just like all the citizens of the city, that would seem that they hate Sula. ",
            "However, no one realized that the heroine was the reason for their solidarity.\n",
            "Duality is also represented in the novel\u2019s symbol, namely the mole above Sula\u2019s eye. ",
            "The change in the mole\u2019s appearance symbolizes the heroine\u2019s maturity and the gradual rejection of social conventions. ",
            "In turn, it is also the opposite feature of Nel\u2019s character, which accepts all the norms. ",
            "Further, there was an ambivalent perception of the mole by different characters: Nel thought it was a rose, representing love, feminine beauty, and friendship. ",
            "Jude perceived it as deceit and seduction, that is, dual and opposite to Nel. ",
            "Thus, the author was able to express the ambiguity of the world and material and non-material things. ",
            "In addition, Toni Morison was able to immerse the reader in the idea that the perception of things largely depends on how one sees them.\n",
            "The duality of the novel also characterizes the end of the book, which at first glance seems tragic. ",
            "The heroine\u2019s death, sadness, tears, and depressive impulse do not seem to belong to an optimistic perception. ",
            "However, the author\u2019s main motive was to display a ray of light in the form of a sincere outburst of love and friendship through Nel\u2019s sadness. ",
            "This formulates the circles of sadness: the first, implicit, displayed in the entire storyline. ",
            "Namely, all the negative events and the environment of the heroes: connection with husbands, difficult living conditions, and the murder of children by the mother. ",
            "Finally, the second obvious circle of sadness symbolizes the main aspects of human life, namely sincerity, self-sacrifice, love, and friendship. ",
            "All this was expressed in a small but main part of the novel, namely in the final impulse of Nel.\n",
            "The ambiguity and depth of the essence of Toni Morrison\u2019s novel can also be seen by analyzing the criticism of the book. ",
            "Thus, at first glance, it seems that the plot describes the impact of betrayal on the friendship of two African American women, but the author does not stop there (Nittle, 56). ",
            "The novel makes one think about what makes a person good or bad and where the line between these concepts lies (Nittle, 56). ",
            "It formulates the vagueness of the boundaries between the basic concepts of morality and life, which gives the reader additional space for analysis. ",
            "In addition, it also symbolizes the ambiguity of the perception of the ending of the novel. ",
            "As already indicated, it may seem to one that the ending cannot be interpreted otherwise than as pessimistic. ",
            "However, given the deeper dimension of the concepts of good and bad, joy and sadness, one may notice an optimistic factor expressed in sincere outbursts.\n",
            "Different perspectives of the perception of the novel are also indicated in the context of displaying different cruel scenes, for example, the murder of a child by a mother. ",
            "The polyphonic nature of Morrison\u2019s narrative should be analyzed through different perspectives, both in Sula and Beloved novels (Palladino, 26). ",
            "This technique plays the role of a double element, expressing cruelty on the one hand and, on the other hand, being a powerful narrative item. ",
            "The purpose of this is primarily to enhance the impression on the reader, as well as to make one notice the striking contrast of the plot elements.\n",
            "To conclude, one learned that due to the dual structure, the ending of the novel formulates an optimistic aspect to a greater extent. ",
            "The ambiguous perception of symbols, such as Sula\u2019s birthmark, as well as the perception of the heroine by the inhabitants of the city and other characters, represents a multi-level structure of life. ",
            "Besides, Nel\u2019s \u201ccircles of sadness\u201d symbolize two factors, hidden, negative, and explicit, formulating sincerity and important moral and life values.\n",

            "Kaplan analyzes the portrayal of women in a film using Laura Mulvey\u2019s The Male Gaze theory and psychoanalysis. ",
            "Kaplan argues that historically women have only been the focus of attention in the melodrama genre, and while melodrama exposes the limitations that the family places on women, it also forces women to accept those limitations as inevitable and normal. ",
            "Kaplan argues that culture is deeply rooted in male and female dominance-submission patterns. ",
            "The male gaze calls for a sexual, political gaze and offers a sexualized way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women. ",
            "In the male gaze, a woman is visually positioned as an object of heterosexual male desire. ",
            "Her feelings, thoughts, and sexual desires are less important than her framing of male desire.\n",
            "The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) is a famous example of the male gaze. ",

            "Indeed, the viewer knows that Cora is sexy even before knowing her name. ",
            "Using close-ups, the camera forces the viewer to look at Cora\u2019s body. ",
            "It creates a way of looking that is sexy and connected to the point of view of the male protagonist. ",
            "In terms of contemporary examples, the Transformers film series (2006\u20132014) presents women as desirable sex objects.\n",
            "Filmmakers often try to avoid portraying female characters as just sex objects by giving them complex backstories, strong motivations, and an active role in the plot of their story. ",
            "However, the male gaze is still common. ",

            "The Grand Canyon and Its Potential Essay\n",
            "The Grand Canyon is one of the most grandiose sightseeing spots in the world. ",
            "It took quite some time to discover and explore this natural work of art due to the structure\u2019s immense size. ",
            "Over time, the Grand Canyon became one of the symbols of the United States and the State of Arizona in particular. ",
            "It is crucial to investigate the past of the Grand Canyon in order to realize its potential and see how this natural wonder could affect human lives beyond traveling and sightseeing. ",
            "The current paper will conduct a thorough study of three articles on the topic of the Grand Canyon to validate that idea.\n",
            "First, it must be noted that the history and culture of Americans living in the area are directly connected to the Grand Canyon. ",
            "For example, Sara Maverick suggested that the rich human history could not be left behind since Native American tribes and numerous miners and archaeologists visited and explored the Grand Canyon throughout the years (\u201cThe Grand Canyon,\u201d 2022). ",
            "Maverick talked about how the Anasazi became one of the biggest groups to populate the Grand Canyon in an attempt to protect themselves from nomads. ",
            "Nevertheless, it is believed that a severe drought has forced the Anasazi to leave their houses carved inside the Grand Canyon (\u201cThe Grand Canyon,\u201d 2022). ",
            "The rich history of mining also haunts this natural wonder to this day, as some of the mines located in the Grand Canyon produced silver, copper, and uranium oxide.\n",
            "Conversely, one should pay attention to the geological history of the Grand Canyon and appreciate its natural features. ",
            "For instance, Marisol West dwelled on the presence of 2-billion-year-old rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon (\u201cThe Grand Canyon,\u201d 2022). ",
            "As a result of a powerful erosion, the Grand Canyon remains a gigantic reminder of the previous eras when natural calamities were much more severe and powerful. ",
            "The fact that the Grand Canyon is still home to the Navajo Indians shows how the natural state of the structure was preserved. ",
            "Every geologic event that occurred since the first settlements of the Anasazi shaped the Grand Canyon in a number of unique ways that are visible to today\u2019s tourists (\u201cThe Grand Canyon,\u201d 2022). ",
            "Thus, numerous floods and erosions only made the Grand Canyon even more grandiose than before.\n",
            "The Grand Canyon National Park supported the ultimate topic of discussion that has to be covered. ",
            "Park team members described the South Rim of the Grand Canyon as one of the most important landscapes across the natural wonder (\u201cGrand Canyon,\u201d 2022). ",
            "It can be noted that there are various flora and fauna species populating the canyon area, from the gray-green forests to gopher snakes. ",
            "Even though precipitation on the South Rim is severely limited (approximately 15 inches per annum), some of the animals and plants easily survive the heat and the lack of water. ",
            "In order to see all of the unique species, visitors have to use their receptors carefully.\n",
            "Overall, it is safe to say that the Grand Canyon truly affects humans beyond being a sightseeing spot and a natural wonder. ",
            "For many scientists and research enthusiasts, the Grand Canyon is going to remain an unremitting source of knowledge. ",
            "Many visitors would be amazed by the history of the Anasazi and the Navajo Indians who lived and still live inside the Grand Canyon, respectively. ",

            "The Impact of Russian Invasion on Global Economy Essay\n",
            "In the modern world, when all countries are closely interacting with each other, such events as war can have a significant impact on the global economy. ",
            "Even though the Russian invasion has just started, it has already caused a number of economic issues. ",
            "The major problems include the increasing transportation costs and disruption of the global supply chain. ",
            "Also, since Russia is considered to have one of the most substantial cyber warfare capabilities, worldwide cyber aggression may become a major economic threat.\n",
            "In the present moment, the main concern for the global economy is the disruption of supply chains that are caused by Russia engaging in the war. ",
            "Russian suppliers are distributed all around the globe. ",
            "More than 2100 the U.S and 1200 European firms have at least one direct supplier from Russia or Ukraine. ",
            "However, regarding indirect suppliers, the number of affected organizations increases significantly, reaching about 200000 firms in the U.S. ",
            "and 150000 firms in Europe. ",
            "Therefore, the indirect impact of the conflict on the global supply chain is profound, which results in soaring prices for various materials and goods.\n",
            "The war has a significant impact on commodities and materials. ",
            "Firstly, Russia is the biggest wheat exporter, and Ukraine is among the world\u2019s top exporters of corn. ",
            "The result of their economic isolation can be a price shock on food in the countries that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports. ",
            "Secondly, the invasion impacts the supply of metals and raw materials from these countries, which is a significant threat to some manufacturing companies. ",
            "For instance, Russia possesses about 10% of the world\u2019s copper reserves, apart from other metals, and Ukraine, according to experts, is a profound supplier of minerals.\n",
            "In addition, natural gas and oil prices are also spiking, which leads to increased transportation costs and expensive electricity. ",
            "Since natural gas has become an essential source of energy, the limited supply from Russia can result in financial difficulties for manufacturers and other electricity-dependent facilities. ",
            "For instance, Germany is highly dependent on natural gas in electricity production and manufacturing, making it vulnerable to a gas shortage. ",
            "As a result, the export of automobiles, transport equipment, and electronics from Germany is now disrupted. ",
            "While limited gas supply impedes the world\u2019s manufacturing process, soaring oil prices interfere with global transportation. ",
            "Being one of the leading oil producers, Russia made many companies paranoid about the worldwide energy supply, which has led to oil stockpiling activities and significant price increases of the fuel.\n",
            "However, experts suggest that the main threat to the global supply chain and economy may be caused by Russian cyber-attacks. ",
            "Russia is considered to have one of the world\u2019s most advanced cyber warfare systems that can intervein with the work of crucial economic software. ",
            "For example, Russian hackers already used such cyber technology in Ukraine in 2017. ",
            "The attack resulted in the software malfunction of tax systems and impediment of industrial facilities, causing the damage of 7 billion dollars to various companies.\n",
            "In conclusion, war can create many economic challenges that are especially destructive in the modern interrelated world. ",
            "Political conflicts can disrupt the global supply chain, causing prices of materials, commodities, food, and energy to increase. ",
            "Even though the rising prices are a severe problem, the significant economic concern with today\u2019s war is connected with the threat of cyber security damage.\n"

            "In Bob Dylan\u2019s song Scarlet Town , the world\u2019s view is presented as Dylan sees it. ",
            "By incorporating his thoughts in several words throughout the music, Dylan sets the song as a dancehall from the start to when he makes a request. ",
            "Through intertextuality, Dylan writes the song presenting a state of the interplay between Scarlet Town and other embedded songs. ",
            "The effect of the other songs embedded in Dylan\u2019s song and how they help invoke the overall theme becomes the point of consideration throughout the analysis.\n",
            "The impact Ernest Tubb\u2019s Walking the Floor Over You and Vern Gosdin\u2019s Set \u2018Em Up Joe have on Dylan\u2019s writing style might not mean much for specific references but greatly contributes to the theme. ",
            "The references are significant in presenting pictures and hints that constantly fade in and out in the song. ",
            "The impressionist piece borrows from these specific songs to enable the listener to understand the hints and parodies of Scarlet Town \u2018s world. ",
            "The use of images and hints in the song shows that what appears in the front has a different perspective when the light fades. ",
            "Through the features, the song helps to bring out the notion that everything is concocted from the personalities people have been dealt with throughout their upbrings and genes.\n",
            "The town constitutes distinct features: a bar of heavy drinkers, a junky whore, a dancehall that plays rock n roll of the 1950s, and a folk club. ",
            "Dylan sings, \u201cSet \u2019em up Joe, play Walking The Floor Play it for my flat chested junky whore I\u2019m staying up late and I\u2019m making amends While the smile of heaven descends\u201d (n.p). ",
            "From this part of the song, the narrator acknowledges his negative qualities, but the qualities should not condemn them. ",
            "Dylan embodies the perfect characteristic of what the town shapes people to become, and his cruel description of his lover shows the evil nature he possesses. ",
            "However, despite being cruel, Dylan\u2019s kindness becomes evident when he requests for a song to be played for her. ",
            "Moreover, the narrator acknowledges his imperfections to the point of \u2018making amends,\u2019 being optimistic the heavens will descent on his act of kindness. ",
            "Therefore, it is best to accept things for what they are since everything mentioned is all here in the town, and it is all good.\n",
            "Repeatedly, the incorporated references in the song make the audience acknowledge that life follows through a pattern people have no control over. ",
            "Escape, should it ever happen, only comes too late in life. ",
            "Both the bad and the good exist as Ying and Yang, which is the truth about life. ",
            "There is nothing people can do to alter their fate, and since change rarely comes, individuals keep fighting the same wars fought by their fathers. ",
            "While signs of progress appear, none happens in people\u2019s lives. ",
            "Dylan sings, \u201dIn Scarlet Town you fight your father\u2019s foes Up on the hill a chilly wind blows You fight \u2018em on high and you fight \u2018em down in You fight \u2018em with whisky, morphine and gin\u201d (n.p). ",
            "However, even that being the case, the narrator keeps believing that everything will be okay. ",
            "Repenting and trying to do things better, no matter what stage in life, will help change one\u2019s fate. ",
            "Therefore, handling issues where Dylan is now of paramount significance since traveling is not a guaranteed way of putting things right.\n",
            "Johnny Ray\u2019s Whiskey and Gin and, more specifically, the lines \u2018I got a gal who drinks whiskey and gin/Kisses me goodnight, hugs and squeezes me tight\u2019 are also used as references in Scarlet Town . ",
            "Evident in \u201cYou fight \u2018em on high and you fight \u2018em down in You fight \u2018em with whisky, morphine and gin,\u201d Dylan shows how relying on drugs and alcohol is the preferred way of dealing with challenges. ",
            "However, the options are simple translations of giving in to the challenges. ",
            "Dylan assumes he is doomed, and this shows a state of weakness in the narrator as the audience wonders why he cannot remain assertive when facing adversity.\n",
            "Lastly, Scarlet Town presents a more detailed study of Barbara Allen\u2019s folk song. ",
            "While Allen\u2019s main theme tells of a tale where a young woman spurns her lover on his deathbed and comes to regret it, Dylan brings out a world full of both bad and good. ",
            "However, Dylan argues there is no way the bad in the world can prevent combining the two forms from leading to eventual good. ",
            "The entire world presented in the town appears complete in several ways. ",
            "The events of the characters present a global real-life significance that resonates on beauty and ugliness, wealth and poverty, cruelty and kindness, and life and death.\n",
            "Conclusively, the impact of the references in the song Scarlet Town helps shape the world\u2019s view as Dylan presents it to be significantly resonating with all manner of real life. ",
            "As established, the presentation ranges from cruelty and kindness to life and death, and Dylan shows that sometimes relying on drugs and alcohol is the preferred way of dealing with challenges. ",

            "The tragic story involved four American Soldiers who in drunken rage entered an Iraqi Civilian household, gang-raping the daughter and murdering the whole Family. ",
            "This would have been not discovered and covered up if not for the bravery and moral agency of Pvt. ",
            "Justin P. ",
            "Watt, a young member of the platoon who privately investigated the unfolding events and eventually chose to report it in order to bring those responsible to justice. ",
            "In his time in Iraq, Pvt. ",
            "Watt faced a potentially morally injurious experience serving as an indirect witness to the massacre, which created psychological distress and ethical challenges for him, and an action plan for renewal is discussed.\n",
            "Morally injurious experiences (MIEs) define as events, exposures, or triggers that transgress or violate an individual\u2019s deeply held moral beliefs or values, associated with psychological distress as a response. ",
            "The MIE which affected Pvt. ",
            "Watt was the massacre. ",
            "He was not present, but he was a second-hand witness, first hearing the story from Sgt. ",

            "Pvt. ",

            "Pvt. ",
            "Watt realizes his platoon friends with Green and potentially others had raped a teenager, murdered a Family, and covered up evidence. ",
            "Furthermore, that Sgt. ",
            "Yribe failed his responsibility as team leader to attain justice despite knowing the facts, and is responsible for the cover-up as well. ",
            "Pvt. ",
            "Watt reflects, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine what it would have been like, hearing everyone screaming,\u201d which suggests that he is visualizing the events based on known information. ",
            "Despite not physically present or involved in the massacre, he is feeling the guilt and aftereffects not dissimilar to if he seen it happen. ",
            "These are signs of PTSD and psychological distress.\n",
            "This event has a direct negative impact on the Soldier by placing him in a morally compromising position. ",
            "Pvt. ",
            "Watt is torn between loyalty to his platoon and friends and the Army code and moral values, experiencing psychological distress. ",
            "Furthermore, the Soldier is noticeably horrified at the potential that his platoon members and American Soldiers could have engaged in such unethical and monstrous behavior. ",
            "Pvt. ",
            "Watt griefs for the loss of innocent Civilian lives and questions his morality as a Soldier and member of the US Army. ",
            "He has to consider the impact of his choices on his ethics as well as the families of those Soldiers and Civilians that had died in the war. ",
            "Pvt. ",
            "Watt sees rightly that the massacre represents an act of disproportionate violence inflicted on others, particularly Civilians. ",
            "The US Soldiers committed the murder of innocents, children, and abused this Civilian Family both, more harshly than any combatant and without regard for their dignity and life. ",
            "This is a direct root for cause of a MIE.\n",
            "The first repair/renewal response that will help Pvt. ",
            "Watt in this case is connection. ",
            "He feels isolated and hated, receiving death threats for his choice. ",
            "This is an event that he likely keeps private for his own safety and feels that there is no one he can trust. ",
            "A connection should be established, most likely with other soldiers who had served, witnessed some form of similar MIEs targeted against Civilians or innocents, and who share similar views and concerns. ",
            "Trust and belief in mankind must be re-established as a means of healing, for the Soldier to understand that they are not alone, and their choice was correct. ",
            "Another appropriate repair response is a dialogue with a benevolent moral authority. ",
            "The aim is for the Soldier to verbalize the MIE and how it affected them and what they believe the consequences to their life should be. ",
            "This can be a conversation with a real being or not, potentially if the individual is religious, with God or a representative of God, such as a pastor. ",

            "Shakespeare\u2019s play Macbeth has been filmed dozens of times by great directors from all over the world. ",
            "The film analyzed here was released in Britain in 2010 and directed by Rupert Goold. ",
            "In fact, the British gave the world the most significant number of Macbeth \u2019s adaptations. ",
            "This version of Macbeth is not considered to be the most viewed and discussed one. ",
            "However, it has a lot of great qualities to be in the range of the best movies based on Shakespeare\u2019s plays.\n",
            "The major attractive part about this film is the actor that plays Macbeth\u2019s role in the movie. ",
            "It is Patrick Stewart, the well-known actor for his role in the X-Men film series. ",
            "Stewart has performed a tremendous work to feel the depth of Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth. ",
            "In the gestures, the way of speaking, and delivery, one can feel the two-sided nature of this Scottish general. ",
            "While Stewart demonstrates Macbeth\u2019s power and force, there is also a sense of vulnerability and uneasiness in character. ",
            "As for the other actors, I was not familiar with them before watching the movie. ",
            "The actor whose style and play I liked is Kate Fleetwood as Lady Mcbeth. ",
            "She looks really evil and frightening because of her icy manner.\n",
            "The design of the costumes and locations is really modern, which makes this adaptation to be highly changed from the original. ",
            "While Shakespeare\u2019s play happened in the 11th century in Scotland, the movie\u2019s design is more similar to the events of the 20th century. ",
            "It is unusual to see such a kind of author\u2019s \u201creading\u201d of the play, which everyone knows from school days. ",
            "It seems that Goold wanted to analyse the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century through the prism of the 11th-century play. ",
            "The most remarkable scene is when the man, whose face was not shown, watched the military parade of troops similar to Soviet or Nazi marches. ",
            "After that, the movie shows a large hall with a portrait of Macbeth, decorated in the style of communist leaders (Stalin or Mao Zedong).\n",
            "Corresponding to the era of the first half of the 20th century, the costumes in the film Macbeth make sense. ",
            "As for me, almost all the costumes resemble the NKVD officers\u2019 clothes and the top leadership\u2019s uniforms during the Great Terror of the 1930s. ",
            "For example, in the first part of the film, Macbeth\u2019s uniform and Stewart\u2019s moustache are extremely similar to what Joseph Stalin looked like. ",
            "Another memorable costume is the clothes of three witches, who were depicted in the film as hospital nurses. ",
            "Their pale faces and identical hospital uniforms create a horror aesthetic, so their appearance will bring more anxiety as the film evolves.\n",
            "Finally, the way the sound and light are used may interest many of Macbeth \u2019s viewers. ",
            "The movie\u2019s soundtrack is constructed in a way to increase the intensity and unsettling feeling through the play\u2019s plot. ",
            "This music couples with the sudden and frightening noises that can appear at any film stage. ",
            "Different screams, sudden distortions, and just loud sounds keep the horror aesthetic on a high level. ",
            "Concerning the effect of lights, there is no single scene where there will be no black-colour dominance. ",
            "Another peculiarity is that the director tries to show the ambiguity of the characters by using white-black costumes. ",
            "It creates the colour dichotomy, which seems to have a hidden meaning.\n",
            "To sum up, the 2010 version of Macbeth demonstrates the astounding mix of medieval Scottish history and 20th-century nefarious events. ",
            "Rupert Goold managed to \u201crefresh\u201d the classical play and made viewers reflect on the actuality of the story in Macbeth . ",
            "At the same time, it seems that Gould has not managed to move away from the central figure of Patrick Stewart. ",
            "Other actors, except Kate Fleetwood, were in the shade of the great actor.\n"

            "In addition to the titles of academic journals and articles, it is possible to determine which field of science an article belongs to from its content, the language used, and the focus of the study. ",
            "For example, an article from the humanities explores people\u2019s relationships of communication, satisfaction, and beliefs (Willoughby et al. ",
            "1631). ",
            "These parameters are quite abstract and relate more to the field of human perception than to precise measurements. ",
            "The article from the field of social sciences already uses the study of correlations, describing the relationship between phenomena and their influence on each other (Geist 1).\n",
            "Additionally, the researchers use more different graphs and numbers and focus on social and economic contexts. ",
            "An article from the field of natural sciences no longer uses statistical data but the study of various phenomena through the construction of systems and models. ",
            "For example, Schacht and Kramer consider the human mating system through the lens of its influence on evolution (2). ",
            "Thus, these articles use a more experimental design with application to the global development of the human species.\n",
            "Within the framework of the differences in articles that relate to various fields of science, a number of features can be distinguished by which a scientific area can be identified. ",
            "First of all, the humanities pay more attention to the perception of a particular phenomenon and use surveys of participants for research. ",
            "The social sciences are characterized by the search for correlations between phenomena and the social context, as well as the identification of statistical patterns. ",
            "Finally, for the natural sciences, an experimental study is important that can describe one or another phenomenon of nature or humans.\n",
            "Articles also differ in organizational structure depending on the field of science to which they belong. ",
            "Thus, an article from the humanities field contains background information, a description of the research methodology, including the measurement procedure, presents the results, as well as a discussion. ",
            "The social science article contains background information, data and methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. ",
            "Notably, the social science article clearly lists the data that will be used to find correlates. ",
            "At the same time, in an article that refers to the humanities, various characteristics are used that are identified through various survey points.\n",
            "The article from the natural sciences is a literary review, so its structure reflects the description of key concepts related to the influence of monogamy on the evolution of the human species. ",
            "Compared to other papers presented, this paper focuses solely on the biological factors that shape the behavior of an entire species. ",
            "The structure of the article reflects its focus and describes correlates such as concealed ovulation, testis size, sexual dimorphism, and others.\n",
            "Looking more closely at one of the articles, important writing techniques can be used in other papers. ",
            "In particular, Willoughby et al. ",
            "use their research and its results to test existing views and models of marital centrality. ",
            "The authors use existing theoretical knowledge as a framework to shape their own research. ",
            "This technique allows them to make their paper more evidence-based while also offering significant correlates that already exist for research and consideration. ",
            "This aspect offers an interesting technique that can be used to write research papers. ",
            "First of all, it helps in the effective use of existing information in the field to form a new body of knowledge.\n",
            "I could borrow this strategy into my own writing as it will allow me to create more professional academic papers. ",
            "This technique allows you to build a consistent structure of the study. ",
            "Within this structure, the authors first present the existing knowledge and later present the gaps that can be identified in it. ",
            "After that, the authors propose their own research, which could provide results to fill the existing gaps in this area. ",
            "In my opinion, this technique offers consistent guidelines for writing a quality academic paper that I can use in the future.\n",
            "The main difference between the three articles is the purpose of their writing, which is determined by the scientific field. ",
            "For example, the purpose of a humanitarian article is to explore \u201clinks between marital centrality and commitment, communication, and relationship satisfaction\u2026 at the individual level and couple level\u201d (Willoughby et al. ",
            "1634). ",
            "The social sciences consider how \u201cmacroeconomic circumstances, gender relations, and policy regimes shape heterosexual marriage rates and timing, and how these mechanisms may have changed over time\u201d (Geist 2). ",
            "The natural science article describes mating patterns found in the human species (Schacht and Kramer 1-2). ",
            "Thus, these articles are intended to consider marriage at various levels of its functioning.\n",
            "In particular, the humanities focus more on the relationship and emotional aspects of marriage among individuals. ",
            "The social sciences view marriage in the context of social and economic change, emphasizing it as part of the structure of society. ",
            "Finally, the natural sciences consider the role of marriage as a biological, behavioral tool that shapes the specific characteristics of the human species. ",
            "Thus, the three articles look at marriage from very different perspectives at the individual, social, and species levels. ",
            "Each of the articles offers a certain view on the importance of this construct and phenomenon in various spheres of human life and society. ",
            "However, they also define marriage and its goals differently depending on the context of the study.\n",
            "The citation styles in an article from the humanities and sciences are similar and offer citations to the author of the work and the year of its publication. ",
            "The social science article uses footnotes, most of which are located in the background information section. ",
            "The format of the articles is also similar and offers a division into sections as well as subsections that form the overall structure of the article. ",
            "Undoubtedly, since an article from the field of natural sciences is in the nature of a literature review, the structure and format in it are different because it does not contain a research part. ",
            "At the same time, in this article, one can find the largest number of references to previous studies than in other papers.\n",
            "The formats of humanities research and social science research are very similar and contain the same elements. ",
            "At the same time, due to the nature of the article, the format of research from the field of natural sciences is significantly different and corresponds to the style of the review. ",
            "The language used in the article also varies because it reflects the different focuses of the research. ",
            "In particular, different technical terminology is used depending on the field of study, which is also explained in detail in the text. ",
            "The humanitarian article uses a focus on relationships, satisfactions, and beliefs; the article on asocial sciences focuses on social and economic correlates; an article from the natural sciences uses biological terms. ",

            "Studying the literature of previous times can provide valuable insight into how society was organized and what people had views on social, political, and other problems. ",
            "This work explores the literary work of Franz Kafka, \u201cMetamorphoses.\u201d Therefore, this paper is a piece of literature that is still relevant and could be applied to society today in several ways. ",
            "The main problem of this response highlights the problem of loneliness of people in the world, despite the simple idea of a good life.\n",
            "Before discussing the relevance of the work under study, it is necessary to have an understanding of its plot. ",
            "Therefore, \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d will tell about Gregor Zamsa, an ordinary seller who one day a man realizes that he has turned into an insect of enormous size. ",
            "The rest of the story focuses on his attempts to adapt to the new conditions of life. ",
            "Family members lock him in a separate room and feed him; later, Gregor dies of poisoning.\n",
            "Therefore, \u201cThe Metamorphoses\u201d can be easily attributed to current society. ",
            "Research shows that \u201cit no longer follows the methodical analysis of souls, but seeks the inner disorder, the secret of the character\u2019s existence\u201d (Balaban 235). ",
            "One of the most striking is the problem of loneliness of people. ",
            "Despite the fact that the main protagonist had a family he took care of and supported, he was left alone in the end. ",
            "Even at the end of the work, the author shows a picture of a happy walking family, according to which it is impossible to understand that they only lost one of their members. ",
            "In the modern world, people are also suffering from loneliness, which is especially provoked by the development of new technologies. ",
            "Individuals are increasingly locked into their separate worlds and cease to interact even with the close people themselves.\n",
            "In conclusion, it must be underlined that Franz Kafka created his works during such a period as modernism. ",
            "It is characterized by the destruction and confrontation of established social norms. ",
            "Therefore, the author of \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d focuses on the problem of lack of love and loneliness of people, which can be related to the modern world. ",

            "It is stated that \u201clarge language models like GPT-3 are trained using vast bodies of text, much it was taken from the internet, in which they encounter the best and worst of what people put down in words\u201d (Heaven par. ",

            "Since the given tool from OpenAI relies on learning from all sources of English texts, it is used to produce highly offensive and toxic language. ",
            "However, the new update minimizes such a problem by a significant margin, which generates less erroneous, misinformed, and offensive texts.\n",
            "It is important to note that GPT-3 is still in its rudimentary stage, which means that its implications are minor as of today. ",
            "However, the improvements, such as InstructGPT, create leaps in AI\u2019s learning process, accelerating its maturity as a usable product. ",
            "Future business implications are massive, where any form of repetitive and non-creative text-generating jobs will become obsolete since GPT-3 will be able to perform these tasks much more effectively and efficiently.\n",
            "In conclusion, I think that GPT-3 is a highly promising instrument, which requires learning assistance conducted frequently. ",
            "I agree that GPT-3 should not rely solely on self-learning, and professionals should direct the AI. ",
            "The text generator is of paramount importance when it comes to making a substantial shift in progress toward automating many text-related jobs, which also include programming. ",

            "There is, however, less awareness of deep-sea drilling and the impacts on the habitat and human life in the oceans and along the coasts. ",
            "The augmentation will create an apprehension of the environmental effects oil companies drilling close to water bodies have on human and aqua life. ",
            "The theme of the argumentation is to stop deep-sea drilling. ",
            "To make my request clear and direct so that the audience would comprehend it without any misunderstanding or appearing of additional questions about the content of my visual argument, I will use an image with a help of the text reflecting on deep-water drilling, threats to habitats, and life.

            "People unevenly feel the impacts of ocean drilling, and the newspaper spread should enhance awareness among the general population\n",
            "The core of the argument is the environmental impacts of deep-sea drilling. ",
            "The core argument should challenge the human/environment dichotomy. ",
            "Deep-sea drilling creates very high risks of oil spillage that is disastrous to marine wildlife and contributes to climate change. ",

            "It is one of the masterpieces of the Renaissance embodying the typical lines and techniques of that period.\n",
            "The artwork depicts Madonna staying close to Jesus\u2019 Child. ",
            "She looks with passion and love at him, while the baby looks at the Virgin Mary. ",
            "The composition of the paper is balanced. ",
            "First, the eye looks at Madonna and her head, but then it moves to a child and his image. ",
            "The activity of the painting remains within the image borders, as only background scenery is seen. ",
            "The work is not monumental; however, its size helps to create a specific composition with full-size figures on it. ",
            "However, the baby might seem too big, which can be symbolic to emphasize his importance.\n",
            "The colors used are neutral as the painter avoids using bright spots. ",
            "The overall gamma is neutral, with the closes and figures\u2019 heads being the most notable elements. ",
            "All colors are naturalistic as the painter tried to create an accurate image of these two outstanding figures. ",
            "Thus, the use of oil and tempera adds some specific roughness to brushstrokes and makes the painting look unique.\n",
            "The image also managed to create a clear illusion of depth as the background depicts a particular landscape that also looks realistic. ",
            "The main figures are in the center and at the bottom of the composition, which helps to find them, seeing the background at the same time. ",
            "All lines are clear and well-defined, and many details are given to clothes, faces, and other objects depicted in the image. ",
            "At the same time, the figures look soft and tender. ",
            "In general, the picture fits with the stylistic period when it was created, as such motifs, colors, and shapes were typical for artists of that period. ",
            "The artist wanted to show the human nature of Jesus and, at the same time, emphasize the purity of the whole family.\n",
            "Altogether, Madonna Adoring the Child is a picture perfectly demonstrating the style and ideas of that period. ",
            "Its central theme, which is depicting the Virgin Mary and Jesus, is one of the frequently used motifs of that period. ",

            "Historical Overview\n",
            "Multiple religions characterize Brazil as the Church emerged due to the Portuguese conquests. ",
            "It is believed that the first religion to enter Brazil with the Portuguese was Catholicism. ",
            "The starting point is the Catholic Mass of 1500, verified by some of the first colonizers. ",
            "Subject to the strong influence of colonization and the rigidity of their forces, Brazil struggled to cope with the religious onslaught. ",
            "Missionary and educational activities helped strengthen Catholicism and the formation of elite communities. ",
            "Although the influence was strong, early Catholicism intertwined traditional motifs and cultural beliefs.\n",
            "Catholicism spread to Brazil for two centuries: monasteries and indigenous church schools. ",
            "By 1551 a separate diocese was formed, and then the first bishop became the head of the religious current. ",
            "By the end of the 17th century, Bahia became the seat of Catholicism, followed by bishoprics in Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, and Maranh\u00e3o. ",
            "Bishops, orders, and holy clergy led the Catholic Church to unite the people. ",
            "During the period of Catholicism, the citizens of Brazil fought for their independence, trying to find a way to overthrow the colonial system. ",
            "Brazilian independence was declared in 1822, after which the first Brazilian constitution was adopted. ",
            "The constitution regulated the rights and freedoms of Brazilian citizens and freedom of religion. ",
            "It led to the Roman Catholic Church becoming the state church, so believers were legally protected. ",
            "In 1889 Brazil declared itself a republic, after which the Church was separated from the state.\n",
            "Until 1930, the Catholic Church had a strong influence on the population\u2019s life. ",
            "The Church intervened in public discourse and imposed restrictions on private life. ",
            "In the 1930s, the Church supported an authoritarian regime, bringing the Church back to the forefront. ",
            "After World War II, however, Catholicism began to lose its influence. ",
            "Brazilian citizens were finally able to receive a diverse education, which lowered the status of the Church\u2019s schools. ",
            "The military dictatorships of 1964 and 1980 were catalysts in the subversion of the population and the Church. ",
            "Catholicism had divided into currents by the end of the 20th century, with radical or conservative churches responding differently to social problems. ",
            "Catholicism has declined significantly since the last century due to political and social divisions.\n",
            "The Current Situation\n",
            "Brazil is a multireligious country with Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity, marginal communes, and Catholicism. ",
            "Catholicism is widespread among about two-thirds of the population and permeates various structures: politics is mainly influenced by religion. ",
            "In Brazil, at least five party formations have incorporated Christian values into their ideological platforms. ",
            "For example, the Christian Workers Party was formed in 1985 and is a conservative political branch. ",
            "The Social Democratic Christian Party of Brazil (PSDB) advocates center-right movements toward neoliberalism. ",
            "Although the religious ideas of public figures are not limited to parties, politicians and officials have certain beliefs broadcast to the public. ",
            "This presentation leads to social conflicts in electioneering.\n",
            "The other side of the religious component of Brazilian political life is discrimination. ",
            "Although Brazil is generally regarded as a country of tolerance, including racial-religious, tolerance figures for minority religions are still far from ideal. ",
            "In general, the state preserves the rights of citizens to freedom of religion, but there is a pronounced aggressive attitude toward people of Afro-Brazilian faiths. ",
            "Discrimination cases are pretty frequent, but there are still hotlines, human rights organizations, and structures to promote other religions.\n",
            "The number of churches in Brazil is nearly 300, with dioceses and archdioceses. ",
            "Often churches as organizations are vital instruments of pressure on social life. ",
            "It creates more prejudices about religion, leading to new social conflicts. ",
            "Although the political situation with religion is unstable, support for the educational aspects is strong. ",
            "Despite the decline of Catholicism, more than 30 universities in Brazil are supported by the Catholic diocese. ",
            "The Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais is recognized as the best among the private universities, providing predominantly academic training but with a permanent message of social inclusion.\n",
            "Competition and discrimination between movements caused Catholicism to surrender to the influence of other denominations. ",

            "The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300\u20131589 is a book by Toby Green that examines conditions in Iberia and West Africa in the 14 th and 15 th centuries that set the stage for the subsequent complex interactions between Europeans and Africans. ",
            "Despite the title, the book mostly focuses on 1460 to 1589, when Cape Verde Islands hosted most of the trade. ",
            "The book will interest Atlantic explorers and the general public curious about European expansion and maritime trade (Shumway 731). ",
            "However, it may not be the most accurate predictor of the subsequent historical events. ",
            "Green thoroughly analyzes Cape Verde as becoming a place where European colonizers shipped, traded, and used enslaved Africans for agricultural cultivation. ",
            "He then portrays the settlers from Iberia, mostly New Christian Jews, arguing that their prior exposure to violence and exclusion in Europe influenced how they based a new society on slavery and the slave trade in the new location. ",
            "The narrative then compares the African situation with other slave trades, including Islamic slave-owners engaged in the trans-Saharan trade, Mandinka diaspora, and early slave trade from Upper Guinea by Portuguese. ",
            "Drawing on archival sources in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, most of the narrative focuses almost exclusively on coastal and island locations of the Iberian trade. ",
            "Additionally, inland Africa and places in Europe and the Americas connected to Cape Verde by sea trade are occasionally mentioned. ",
            "Green covers the earliest European maritime activity and settlement phase in the Cape Verde Islands and the West African coast between the Senegal River and Sierra Leone. ",
            "The last part of the narrative states that colonizers then used the slave trade experience in West Africa in the Americas to suppress the Native American population.\n",
            "The author\u2019s overarching aim in comparing worldwide slave trades is to state that many of the historical numbers have been underestimated. ",
            "However, this argument does not address a still highly uncertain number of enslaved Africans taken out on slave ships, and thus the quantitative methods to estimate the volume of trade will likely refute this interpretation. ",
            "Moreover, Greene rejects that African gold was more important than slaves to the first generations of European traders in Africa, a generally supported historical view (Shumway 730). ",
            "Lastly, Green fails to see the global picture: for instance, the Upper Guinea slave trade before 1589 represents only 1-2 % of the total slave trade. ",
            "Greene\u2019s desire to \u2018redefine\u2019 the entire transatlantic slave trade and emphasize the dominant role of Cape Verde and Upper Guinea discredits the extant historical work of on the early slave trade from West-Central Africa. ",
            "Furthermore, the exaggerated claim about Atlantic colonization impacted by the African slave trade habits calls for additional analysis. ",
            "While the narrative certainly contributes to a historical understanding of the Atlantic world formation, it doubtfully advances one\u2019s understanding of later world histories, such as the colonization of Africa and economic globalization (Shumway 730). ",
            "Moreover, Green claims that historians have failed to appreciate the impact of the extermination of the Native American population on the subsequent forced migration of Africans to the Americas. ",
            "Such a claim is untrue \u2013 there is prevailing acknowledged information on America\u2019s labor shortage and its\u2019 impact of increased colonists\u2019 demand for slaves in public education (Shumway 730). ",
            "Overall, The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589 contributes to the historical understanding of the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa and places the Cape Verde Islands at the center of its history.\n",

            "The paper will compare and contrast the cultures of Saudi Arabia and Australia based on the masculinity versus femininity and uncertainty avoidance dimensions of Hofstede\u2019s cultural framework.\n",
            "Masculinity relies on assertiveness, achievement, success reward in the society indicating competitiveness amongst the individuals. ",
            "On the contrary, femininity displays a preference for the value of life, cooperation, caring for the needy, and humility. ",
            "From the business perspective, masculinity refers to toughness, while femininity can be termed as tender. ",
            "On the other hand, the uncertainty avoidance dimension indicates the extent to which people feel uneasy concerning uncertainty.\n",
            "Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimension Framework\n",
            "Geert Hofstede developed Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimension framework around 1970s. ",
            "The dimensions established indicate the effects of culture on the values of the people in a given society. ",
            "Even though some scholars believe the framework has some drawbacks (Beugelsdijk and Welzel, 2018, pp.1469). ",
            "According to Sajadi and Badreh (2019, p. ",
            "123), some of the limitations associated with the models include using countries as units for investigating the difference in culture is not appropriate. ",
            "Additionally, the number of models is insufficient to explore the cultural aspects of the people, and lastly, the usage of questionnaires to study culture.\n",
            "The major shortcoming of the framework is that one company did the research making the sample size narrow, increasing the chances of bias of the study. ",
            "Furthermore, some countries have several cultures, making it challenging to apply the cultural models in such cases. ",
            "Despite the model\u2019s weaknesses, understanding the framework is useful in the business world as it allows the managers to identify misunderstandings that come because of cultural differences (Rodr\u00edguez-Rivero et al. ",

            "According to the findings of Hofstede\u2019s research, the dimension score is about 60, indicating a good drive towards achievement (Al-Hilabi and Khan, 2021, p.448). ",
            "In this society, men are respected and take high roles in the community and business as well. ",
            "The masculine understand that people must work to live, making them more aggressive in their businesses, while the feminine culture believes in lives to work.\n",
            "Australia has a dimension score of about 61, showing a significant effect of masculinity in their culture. ",
            "In such cases, both men and women are success-oriented, making them focus on achieving good results in their endeavors (George and Loosemore, 2019, p.425). ",
            "There is a clear distinction in gender roles, and males are expected to take the lead and be assertive in every situation. ",
            "In an organization, higher ranks are favored to men as well as their remuneration package. ",

            "The Saudi Arabians believe in they say \u2018time is money they always work hard, and they are uncomfortable with unclear circumstances. ",
            "They adopt and implement strict rules, policies, laws, and regulations to control everything and avoid uncertainty. ",
            "Their behavior, religion, and communication are the key cultural areas that show uncertainty avoidance; for example, they strictly follow the Islamic religion, like having a prayer five times a day is a routine that makes them comfortable with what is happening and that which will follow.\n",
            "In Australian culture, people are slightly open to trying emerging ideas. ",
            "Having a score of around 51 from Hofstede\u2019s research proves that most individuals can quickly adapt to changes that come during their lives. ",
            "Australians are open to change and are ready to try new ideas. ",
            "This is brought by their low uncertainty avoidance, making them good in business investment since they are not scared of failures and associated risks.\n",
            "Overall, Australians moderately value uncertainty avoidance, unlike Saudi Arabia, where the culture is sensitive about other traditions. ",
            "Australians can adjust and accommodate the doubts of the future since they do not have strict laws that bind them to a specific behavior. ",
            "At the same time, Saudi Arabia citizens are more rigid to changes based on their strong religion and other laws. ",
            "The two nations have a significant difference in culture as per the model of uncertainty avoidance. ",

            "The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver reveals a heartfelt approach to statistical interpretations and predictions of data. ",
            "The text explains why so many predictions fail and how researchers fall victim to masses of data while finding important signals is mostly a matter of caution, diligence, and correctly assessing one\u2019s abilities. ",
            "The text asserts that most predictions are wrong because the investigators poorly understand uncertainty and probability. ",
            "A certain statistical problem is presented and evaluated; then, a tentative solution is offered.\n",
            "The author also suggests that statisticians can often benefit from applying multiple perspectives toward a problem. ",
            "However, while it might be possible to obtain multiple data sets for something like weather forecasts, such an approach becomes more challenging with a field like economics or politics. ",
            "Silver (145) argues that many statistical errors occur when researchers attempt to predict too accurately and are overly confident in their abilities. ",
            "He implies that while economic and weather forecasts are equally coarse, economic ones attempt to predict polls and rates in exact numbers rather than settling for an expected range of outcomes (Silver 146). ",
            "Thus, combining multiple attempts with various predictions will yield a more accurate result.\n",
            "Furthermore, the current overabundance of nearly any data type results in muddling the real signals. ",
            "Given the human tendency to seek patterns, people perceive them where they do not exist and build predictions based on false alarms. ",
            "Silver (155) reminds the readers that \u201ccorrelation does not imply causation.\u201d For instance, with the sheer multitude of economic indicators, some coincidental correlations are bound to arise (Silver 153). ",
            "Therefore, each potential causation should be not only subjected to the standard test of statistical significance but the simple test of common sense.\n",
            "After systematically refuting the wrongs in the world of statistical predictions, Silver usually offers some solutions for the given problem. ",
            "His all-encompassing suggestion to make the predictions better is to use Bayes\u2019 theorem of conditional probability or Bayesian reasoning. ",
            "The theorem allows predicting the likelihood of a theory or hypothesis under the assumption that some even has happened before that (Silver 198). ",
            "Silver (198) uses the opportunity to remind readers that the idea behind Bayes\u2019 theorem is not that one updates the probability estimates just once. ",
            "Rather, The Signal and the Noise calls for continuous review of assumptions and predictions as new evidence presents itself. ",
            "In this part of the book, the author highlights the vitality of staying open to new information and thinking \u2018probabilistically\u2019 about the world.\n",
            "Subsequently, the argument is posed that all models simplify the universe, as they must otherwise be given endless details. ",
            "In that, Silver (188) is a firmer believer that \u201call models are wrong, but some models are useful.\u201d Therefore, it is wrong to believe that applying an ideal and universal model to a given problem is possible, given the often intermixed and incomplete nature of the real world. ",
            "However, Silver (327) notes that imperfect predictability is not an excuse to abandon action altogether \u2013 he draws on the example of climate change, admitting the uncertainty in climate models. ",
            "However, this uncertainty justifies the need to focus on climate change mitigation because the potential risk of the problem being worse than anticipated entails much more negative consequences than in the median case.\n",
            "In conclusion, The Signal and the Noise encourages its readers to honor the Bayesian, \u2018probabilistic,\u2019 way of thinking regardless of whether it may seem uncomfortable at first. ",
            "The narrative calls to know where the prior beliefs and future assumptions are coming from to make truly careful and exact predictions. ",
            "Furthermore, Silver (368) encourages statisticians to try and err, making many attempts and tests of the ideas that come to mind. ",
            "The author ponders human perceptions of predictability, warning the researchers against the common bias of thinking that they are better at prediction than in reality. ",
            "Overall, this book presents a powerful argument supporting scientific mindset and critical thinking using reliable data analysis.\n",

            "The interest of young people in social networks has specific consequences in the form of mental and physical health problems. ",
            "For example, sitting in a constantly uncomfortable posture while checking social networks leads to the deterioration of the neck and back, provoking chronic pain in these areas. ",

            "This proves that when technology is used incorrectly, it harms comprehensively.\n",
            "The use of social networks by young people also weakens the institution of moral education and disregard for moral values. ",
            "Uncontrolled publications on the social network Instagram with a demonstration of tobacco or the smoking process lead to the popularization of smoking among teenagers. ",
            "Another problem is the distribution of images with alcohol consumption in the same social network, which erases the boundaries of what is permissible for minors. ",
            "In addition, the lack of filtering of images of aggression and cruelty also leads to an increase in the risks of immoral behavior among adolescents whose personality has not yet been fully formed (Krylova 498). ",
            "Having a negative impact on teenagers\u2019 vision of tobacco and alcohol, technologies, where not all information is filtered and suitable for children and adolescents, also harm moral values.\n",
            "The growing popularity of technology among young people has also led to an increase in their involvement in the sex industry, leading to a rise in crime and the experience of traumatic experiences by adolescents. ",
            "Viewing prohibited materials causes the appearance of curiosity, which means the risk of harmful sexual contact even with the right person is becoming possible. ",
            "New technologies and poor awareness of teenagers have also led to an increased risk of sharing an intimate photo on the Internet with an unfamiliar person. ",

            "As a result, the number of sexual crimes, where the victims are teenagers, is increasing because of the lack of filtering information in social networks.\n",

            "The rock and music pop scene were introduced to and gained popularity on television through massive hit shows for teenagers. ",
            "The three primary ones were Where the Action Is on CBS, Shinding on ABC, and Hullabaloo on NBC. ",
            "As more households had access to televisions along with the growth of widespread range of programming, including musical ones, the television played a significant role in distributing the music to the public. ",
            "The bands that appeared on these hit TV shows went on to see significant success in the charts. ",
            "The television shows helped to articulate the new sort of youth music culture and almost became a star-making mechanism in a relationship and profits that the music and television industries shared. ",
            "Some bands, such as the Monkees, the American response to the Beatles, were created with the purpose of television performance as their acting and on-camera comfort as a group were initially prioritized over music. ",
            "However, the Monkees\u2019 music took off astronomically beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. ",
            "Nevertheless, they were a band groomed by the entertainment industry with an emphasis on television performances which took away much of the authenticity, even when compared to their counterparts The Beatles, who although made visual content, focused on their own music strongly (Covach and Flory 212).\n",
            "Television drastically went on to change the landscape of the music industry. ",
            "First, a split formed among artists and fans, with one side focusing on the pop-oriented, performance-focused television music, while the other, typically older audience was drawn to serious-minded music of rock which continued to be played on the radio rather than TV. ",
            "Television also brought about the phenomenon of fictious bands, such as the popular Archies, a cartoon drawn band popular with young teens (Covach and Flory 214). ",
            "This has never been done before and similarly created a new genre of music-television entertainment. ",

            "Exploring this theme in two short stories revealed that Baldwin made a more significant focus on education comparable to Walker. ",

            "Both works highlight and discuss the impact of education\u2019s presence or absence on the characters\u2019 lives.\n",
            "These short stories tell about siblings: Walker\u2019s work narrates about two sisters while Baldwin describes the life of two brothers. ",
            "In both stories, one of the siblings graduated from high school while another lacked education. ",
            "Thereby, it seems that stories aim to compare the lives and intelligence of siblings. ",

            "Sonny\u2019s brother claims that Sonny is \u201cgoing to be sorry later\u201d if he does not finish school (Baldwin 34). ",
            "Sonny\u2019s brother meant that education was the only way to prosper and forget the disadvantaged past; that is why finishing school was a condition that the narrator has set for Sonny (Baldwin 34). ",
            "On the contrary, Mama, the narrator of \u201cEveryday Use\u201d, mentioned \u201ca lot of knowledge we didn\u2019t necessarily need to know,\u201d referring to her daughter\u2019s Dee education (Walker 50). ",
            "She does not exaggerate the importance of education because she was not educated but had a lot of valuable knowledge and skills.\n",
            "Interestingly, in both stories, uneducated siblings appear wiser and more aware of specific topics and issues. ",
            "Back in time, education might create a delusion about one\u2019s intelligence, overstating the significance of existing knowledge and competencies. ",
            "Education was perceived as a privilege in the stories, and those who could attend high school and graduate seemed to be given the right to condemn less fortunate people by default. ",

            "The phrase \u2018global complementation\u2019 was coined by Toyota themselves and essentially can be summarized as a strategy that transforms old manufacturing plants to be able to shift between producing cars for local markets and manufacturing for export. ",
            "It prioritizes flexibility and adaptability while minimizing the loss and time cost of restructuring plants only after observing market fluctuation. ",

            "Portis narrates the story of Mattie Ross, a teenage girl, who is determined to avenge Tom Chaney, her father\u2019s murderer (Dirda Para 2). ",
            "The author uses numerous literary features in order to advance the theme of justice and revenge throughout the book. ",

            "The author uses parallelism of revenge and crime in many instances in the book. ",
            "Ross, the leading character in the novel, exhibits firm moral conviction and a high spirit for revenge to ensure Chaney is excruciatingly punished for slaying her father. ",
            "The protagonist wishes to see him hanged or possibly execute the murderer herself. ",

            "The action prompts Ross to reply, \u201cIt belonged to my father. ",
            "I plan to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails to do so\u201d (Portis 37). ",
            "Her response to this request demonstrates the profound intention to get justice even if it means engaging in criminal act. ",
            "Ross is a daring lady who is ready to persevere beyond limits and commits crime to do what she believes is right. ",
            "The struggle between revenge and crime is endless throughout the novel.\n",
            "Character Development\n",
            "Ross is a firm-willed teenage girl who applies her determination and intelligence to prosper in society where she is constantly underrated. ",
            "When Ross negotiates payment for some of her late father\u2019s property from Colonel Stonehill, she informs him of her plan to retaliate against the assassin. ",
            "Stonehill warns her of the impending difficulty in executing such tactics. ",
            "Ross quickly reacts by noting that, \u201cThe good Christian does not flinch from difficulties. ",
            "Neither does he rashly court them. ",
            "The good Christian is not willful or presumptuous\u201d (Portis 59). ",
            "Conceivably, her action portrays that she understands justice might not come straightforwardly. ",
            "Perhaps at this stage, Ross lacks the knowledge of the high price she might pay from such actions. ",
            "After finally shooting Chaney and believing that she killed him, she retreats into a cavernous hole that turns into a hell-like pit where she starts to suffer the consequence. ",
            "The pony, Blackie, who assists her to safety following her injuries in a ditch is bitten by a snake and later dies when rushing to seek medical attention. ",
            "Ross describes the incident that \u201cBlackie fell to the ground and died, his brave heart burst and mine broken. ",
            "There never lived a nobler pony\u201d (Portis 149). ",
            "Ross did not only lose her treasured friend but also had to individually pay the price by having her arm amputated in attempt to seek justice.\n",
            "Another instance leading to character growth begins when Rooster acts extraordinarily when him alongside Ross encountered two colleagues of Ned Pepper\u2019s criminal group. ",
            "He closely interrogated them and Moon, a decent individual who had just accompanied a wrong assembly, is committed to talking. ",
            "Quincy, the other accomplice in the team, viciously chops Moon\u2019s fingers then proceeds to brutally stab him. ",
            "Rooster speedily shoots and kills Quincy following the commencement of the attack on Moon. ",
            "Rooster responds as Moon pleads for help, \u201cI can do nothing for you, son. ",
            "Your pard killed you and I have done for him\u201d (Portis 90). ",
            "It is evident that Rooster led a deceitful life and paid the cumbersome price where he even damaged his eye while doing what he believed was right. ",
            "Despite all these happenings, Rooster later develops into a caring man who upkeeps both Ross and mule.\n",
            "Humor\n",
            "True Grit is a serious book full of humor in many instances. ",
            "Imagine a teenage girl sets out to retaliate the killing of her father, especially in society full of mutilations, shoot-outs, and hangings (Tartt Para 5). ",
            "In certain cases of pursuing justice and revenge, the wit channels the audience to a period of intense emotion and entertainment. ",
            "Ross encounters LaBoeuf, a renowned Texas Ranger, who has been assisting her to track Chaney in her journey to pursuing justice. ",
            "LaBoeuf\u2019s sole mission is to transfer Chaney to Texas alive. ",
            "While in Texas, he will be arraigned for killing the area senator. ",

            "LaBoeuf offers his help to Ross in capturing Chaney to the promised benefits. ",
            "Nonetheless, her interest fades when he says his motivations are not aligned with hers. ",
            "Later, LaBoeuf discloses that the support of Rooster remains critical. ",
            "He reveals this by saying the need of having, \u201c\u2026someone who knows the ground and can make an arrest out there that will stand up\u201d (Portis 46). ",
            "While LaBoeuf is inspired by the reward he anticipates obtaining, he remains willing to slash a portion of the money to Rooster to ensure pursuing Chaney does not consume much of his time.\n",
            "Some individuals view and seek justice as a profession as demonstrated by LaBoeuf while others are inspired more by simply acting rightfully. ",
            "Rooster represents the latter where he is willing to break the law when it comes to protecting the community and assisting the offended. ",
            "When Ross initially hears of Rooster, she heads to the courtroom during a cross-examination in a case where he is a witness in the murder trial of Wharton Odus. ",
            "Roosters promises the jury that executing the three Wharton members was the perfect thing to do in such a scenario. ",
            "Rooster responds by noting, \u201cThree murdering thieves might have got loose and gone to kill somebody else\u201d (Portis 33). ",
            "Moreover, he remains cognizant that society is substantially more prosperous without free-roaming criminal elements.\n",
            "Opposing Argument\n",
            "On the contrary, the struggles Ross undergoes in the story is represented from the perceptive of battling the corrupt societal systems rather than justice and revenge. ",
            "First robbed of her father then later a family property, Ross remains dedicated to ensure the law takes its course and bring the perpetrators to justice. ",
            "However, she rapidly learns that the authorities cannot fully help her to attain that mission and quickly changes tact to do whatever it takes to execute her plan to the end. ",
            "The author notes, \u201cMattie takes on all manner of authority to right wrongs wrought by corruption and apathy\u201d (Mathews 371). ",
            "The argument symbolises the resolve that became identical with the extremism in America\n",
            "In conclusion, the essay demonstrates a price to pay, especially for individuals determined to obtain justice irrespective of the level of motivation for retribution and the manner of its execution. ",
            "While Ross was inspired by vengeance and later obtained the desired victory, it needed perpetual bravery, making her to suffer the consequence by losing an arm, her virtue, and honorable pony. ",
            "LaBoeuf, the Texas Ranger, pursued justice as a job although he was not emotionally attached, his plans to transfer Chaney to Texas alive never mattered when it was clear Ross\u2019s life was in danger. ",
            "Rooster had a prolonged history of searching for justice and acting rightfully was his underlying principle. ",
            "He paid the price of losing his eye while engaging the gang. ",
            "The novel successfully uses the three literary features to paint the theme of justice and revenge.\n",

            "The Use of Dark Symbolism in \u201cOthello\u201d and \u201cParadise Lost\u201d Essay\n",
            "Writers\u2019 use of various semantic meanings in their creative works is traditionally associated with the author\u2019s internal desire to carry a particular thought through that image. ",
            "Readers who study literature independently tend to interpret these meanings through the prism of their own experience, which means that it is highly likely that the use of the same elements by different authors and even in different books by the same author may not be understood in the same way. ",
            "On the contrary, it is often the case that different authors seek to bring similar meanings to works using the same semantic imagery. ",
            "Among these, the role of contrast, which is achieved on the integration of dark and light images, is particularly noteworthy. ",
            "The most notable use of dark styles is found in John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost and William Shakespeare\u2019s Othello . ",
            "In these classic works of poetry, dark imagery is used extensively by the authors to reinforce opposition to light styles, but additionally, the playwrights showed that darkness should not be taken unequivocally. ",
            "This essay aims to qualitatively explore the use of such meanings in the two works mentioned.\n",
            "One of the central themes of Shakespeare\u2019s classic tragedy is the juxtaposition of contrasts. ",
            "The reader is made aware of this almost from the very beginning when the protagonist Othello is introduced as an African of Moorish descent. ",
            "For sixteenth-century British poetry, the use of dark-skinned characters in prominent plot positions was novel because racist slogans in public sentiment were still strong. ",
            "This is perfectly illustrated in Othello , when the dark-skinned protagonist, which inevitably gives rise to thoughts of \u201ccrude Africans,\u201d turns out to be a decent and pious character. ",
            "Thus, one of the first and most obvious uses of dark imagery is aimed at Shakespeare\u2019s desire to show that not everything \u201cdark\u201d is characterized as evil and bad, as it might seem at first glance.\n",
            "However, it would be erroneous to say that Shakespeare did not use dark imagery, among other things, to demonstrate a dark, hidden style. ",
            "The tragedy of Othello is replete with various uses of dark signs and characters to emphasize the character\u2019s unkindness. ",
            "One of these is Iago\u2019s lieutenant, whose actions are often described in the context of a deep, dark night. ",
            "Against the background of the angelic bright Desdemona, who traditionally wears white dresses, Iago appears as a grim ignoramus whose motives and actions are associated with self-serving evil. ",
            "Thus, it is correct to say that the use of the image of darkness in the work of Othello was also necessary to reinforce the boundary effects between good and bad.\n",
            "Dark styles to enhance the contrast with white imagery are used effectively in another work post-Elizabethan England, namely Paradise Lost by John Milton. ",
            "Milton uses dark colors in his biblical subjects to signify the Devil\u2019s powers. ",
            "The use of dark colors to heighten the ominousness is particularly evident at the beginning of book three when the playwright uses words such as \u201cobscure,\u201d \u201ceternal night,\u201d and \u201cdarkness\u201d (Milton 45). ",
            "This is used for the apparent opposition to the luminous angels and God, which Milton describes in terms of divine-luminous shades. ",
            "These thoughts are borrowed from the evangelist John, who literally wrote that \u201c\u2026God is light; in him, there is no darkness at all\u201d (1 Jh. ",
            "1:5). ",
            "Thus, the use of dark imagery in Milton\u2019s work is implemented to heighten the contrast between light and darkness, good and evil.\n",
            "Once again, however, it would be a mistake to assign unambiguous meaning to the dark rhetoric in Paradise Lost . ",
            "On the contrary, Milton describes God and the Devil as complex characters who do not differ in color alone. ",
            "The most striking episode confirming the non-uniqueness of the images of good and evil relates to the reference to Adam and Eve. ",
            "The people standing between God and the Devil have initially been associated with divine light and goodness, but after Eve\u2019s original sin, provoked by the Devil, they were cast out of the light into darkness. ",
            "By this example, Milton shows that God can also carry darkness if he considers it just since it is his will that people are driven out of Paradise. ",
            "An additional example of the transition between light and darkness, and thus the softening of the boundary between good and evil, is the fallen angels in the service of the Devil: like humans, these angels were sinful because they crossed over to the side of darkness. ",
            "This means that the use of darkness as an image in Paradise Lost has a concomitant meaning, through which Milton tries to show that the world is not composed only of black and white colors.\n",
            "It is not difficult to draw parallels between the use of darkness as a symbol in Othello and Paradise Lost . ",
            "Both Shakespeare and Milton are careful to show that there is no unambiguous dark and light imagery, but that integration must be sought everywhere. ",
            "Thus, the fallen angels and Adam and Eve and Paradise Lost are juxtaposed with Othello, who semantically combines naturally dark colors \u2014 African skin \u2014 with light, kindly urges. ",
            "Furthermore, like Eve, who has committed sin, Othello commits the murder of Desdemona at the end of the poem, which is metaphorically described by Shakespeare as \u201cput out the light and then put out the light\u201d (Shakespeare 235). ",
            "This defines the desire of both playwrights to soften the boundaries set by society between dark and light, white and dark, good and evil since there is nothing unambiguous in this world.\n",
            "Meanwhile, both Shakespeare and Milton turn to the classic use of darker shades to heighten the contrast between light and darkness. ",
            "Thus, the authors of the works often turn to this tool to emphasize the contrast in an image (Kampf). ",
            "These arguments may seem to contradict the previous paragraph, but it is essential to recognize that in order to minimize the boundaries between light and darkness, it was necessary to set these boundaries first. ",
            "Through the darkness, Shakespeare was showing darkness and secrecy, and Milton was addressing darkness when he described the world of hell. ",
            "These associations helped the reader to feel rhetorically more potent the difference between light and dark. ",
            "Thus, this textbook tool for the use of dark styles was used intentionally by the authors, simplifying the work for the reader.\n",
            "To summarize, it is accurate to note that the images of darkness are not unambiguously used in the two works studied. ",
            "Both Shakespeare\u2019s Othello and Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost try to teach the reader not to judge phenomena and people only by the first impression. ",
            "Thus, the darkskin Othello is not connected to natural darkness until the last chapters, and not all of Milton\u2019s angels are genuinely light. ",
            "In addition, the use of darkness has another symbolic function. ",
            "In particular, the contrast between good and evil is heightened through the use of darkness. ",
            "This makes it easier for the reader to understand which character is good and which should be associated with darkness.\n",

            "Woman with a Parasol \u2013 Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. ",
            "Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet\u2019s most well-known and influential works (Brodska\u00efa and Kalitina). ",
            "The two figures in the painting are Monet\u2019s wife Camille and his son Jean.\n",
            "The lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. ",
            "Monet\u2019s wife and child are the focal points of the composition. ",
            "The lower viewpoint allows seeing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which creates a unique lightning effect (Daily Dose of Art). ",
            "Placed in the distance from the woman, the boy\u2019s figure also gives depth to the painting; this compositional technique guides the eye of the observer diagonally downward, which was common for several other works by Monet.\n",

            "It is common for businesses to develop and grow differently, so there is a vast number of ways that companies may evolve. ",
            "It usually depends on the management, industry, objectives, and specific leadership vision. ",
            "These structural types have their own advantages, weaknesses, and challenges. ",
            "For example, many firms face issues while allocating work and then coordinating diverse efforts after dividing responsibilities among groups of employees. ",
            "The former process is called differentiation, and the latter is known as integration, and both play an essential role in organizational structure.\n",
            "To begin with, differentiation is a process of separating a business into key components like units or departments. ",
            "This division is especially common in major corporations because the larger a firm grows, the more challenging it becomes for a single leader to control all its operations. ",
            "Thus, highly differentiated companies provide autonomy to their departments and units, making it easier to organize productive and effective work in all components. ",
            "Noticeably, the corporate environment and culture may vary significantly in different units, which sometimes brings additional issues. ",
            "Amazon and Apple are examples of companies that successfully differentiate their operations and have many different units.\n",
            "Further, when firms apply differentiation, they still need to effectively perform their various tasks, which is why the process of integration is also significant. ",
            "Overall, integration is the specific coordination of differentiated responsibilities and the work of all components. ",
            "In other words, an organization that is highly integrated can have many various departments that are still closely connected and do not have much independence and autonomy. ",
            "For instance, McDonald\u2019s is a tightly controlled company, and most essential decisions are made by its small administrative group. ",
            "Both integration and differentiation are extremely important and should be basic structures in organizations in order for them to operate effectively and be stronger than their competitors.\n",
            "When it comes to integration, it is essential that firms choose carefully between the two available options. ",
            "Overall, their choices should depend on the company\u2019s industry, level of differentiation and its effectiveness, qualifications of managers, and other crucial factors. ",
            "Organizations can coordinate group and individual efforts in two ways: vertically and laterally. ",
            "The former is tighter, while the latter is more relaxed, informal, flexible, and simple.\n",
            "Vertical integration refers to the system in which a firm\u2019s higher levels use rules and policy, authority, and control and panning methods to coordinate the work of the staff. ",
            "For example, authorized leaders have to make sure that action is aligned with the objectives and strategy of the firm. ",
            "They make decisions, solve issues and conflicts, evaluate performance, and reward or punish employees. ",
            "They also develop rules, policies, and planning and control systems so that the staff knows the work conditions and follows the standardized procedures. ",
            "As mentioned above, all operations and decisions of McDonald\u2019s are controlled by a small group of authorities, which is why it is possible to say that this company uses the vertical type of coordination.\n",
            "Further, lateral integration uses task forces, meetings, gatherings, coordinating roles, matrix structures, and networks to control the efforts of the different units. ",
            "Coordinating groups gather to negotiate and help dovetail the efforts and tasks of various departments. ",
            "Spontaneous informal meetings make it possible for workers from different divisions to discuss some issues. ",
            "Additionally, tasks forces allow the collaboration of diverse specialists when a rapid solution for a problem is required. ",
            "The animation studio Pixar is an example of a company that integrates lateral coordination and does that extremely successfully: the informal connection between the workers and the three main groups allows them to develop more ideas and solve issues quickly.\n"

            "Being a global corporation, Walmart has to consider numerous ways of penetrating domestic markets. ",
            "The appearance of any new entities is complicated by the already saturated state of most markets. ",
            "However, Walmart has the advantage of being one of the world\u2019s largest companies, which gives it leverage when entering a new market. ",
            "At the same time, even Walmart is not invincible to local specifics. ",
            "Nuances in-laws, financial and economic conditions, and even cultural relativity can offset the efforts of new entrants. ",
            "Therefore, using the same strategy for every market is short-sighted. ",
            "I agree with Walmart\u2019s decision to penetrate domestic markets via different ownership forms.\n",
            "A joint venture is a form of ownership that presupposes sharing of risks and costs between parent companies. ",
            "Companies use this strategy when the risk of entering the market on one\u2019s own (for instance, using the form of a wholly owned subsidiary) is too high. ",
            "Such instability is particularly characteristic of emerging markets, such as India. ",
            "Although it is a growing economy, there are risks pertaining to taxes, bureaucracy, and cultural misunderstanding. ",
            "Therefore, partnering with a local conglomerate Bharti Enterprises was a risk reduction stem for Walmart. ",
            "It should also be noted that this particular venture was ultimately canceled by Walmart buying Bharti\u2019s shares; it did smooth the former\u2019s entrance to the market.\n",
            "A similar situation can be observed in South Africa, where local Massmart sold more than fifty percent of its shares to Walmart. ",
            "Once again, a similar approach is used: diversifying risks by partnering with a local company to enter a high-growth market. ",
            "It should also be noted that unlike in India, Walmart bought the majority stake (51%). ",
            "In essence, it allows the company to make all major decisions in South Africa while delegating day-to-day operations to Massmart, thus capitalizing on local conditions.\n",
            "Walmart\u2019s strategy in Mexico was similar to the one in South Africa \u2013 it established a joint venture with CIFRA. ",
            "Later Walmart acquired a majority in CIFRA and proceeded to rename it into Walmart de Mexico, which continues to operate under this label. ",
            "Expanding into Mexico was not as risky as would later be the case with India, as Mexico is closer to the United States both geographically and economically. ",
            "The most important threat was anti-monopoly laws, which threatened to damage Walmart\u2019s policy of lower prices; however, as Walmart did not buy 100 percent of the stakes, those that remained belonged to local partners, who are able to operate inside the Mexican law framework.\n",
            "The United Kingdom is different in that it is a saturated developed economy. ",
            "Entering it was more challenging than an emerging market. ",
            "The reason why Walmart bought the majority of Asda lay in its availability. ",
            "Had Walmart not acquired the majority, it would have been sold to another company. ",
            "As a result, Walmart could make all decisions itself without considering the needs of a partner.\n",
            "However, it should also be noted that Walmart ultimately sold the majority of its stakes. ",
            "As such, it appears that entering a foreign market should be done with a partnering company, even if it means sharing revenues. ",
            "In India, South Africa, and Mexico, Walmart retains the majority, while in the UK, it is now barely present. ",
            "Therefore, a joint venture is the most viable option for entering and staying in a foreign market.\n"

            "Income inequality has long been considered one of the main factors that significantly undermine the quality of life. ",
            "Moreover, wealth inequality, which allows a handful of people to get much more prosperous at the expense of millions, is even more disturbing. ",
            "At the same time, people around the world are determined to acquire wealth by entirely different means, which can even be controversial. ",
            "Therefore, a dedicated analysis is needed to fully understand the importance of wealth and power in the hierarchy of human values when inequality rates are unprecedentedly high. ",
            "High inequality rates diminish people\u2019s motivation to enhance their living standards, as luxurious lifestyle becomes the primary goal that almost always stays a dream and is full of controversy.\n",
            "Inequality can lead to objective hardships and diminished living standards in many parts of the world. ",
            "Nevertheless, one of the notorious effects of extreme inequality is always the psychological perception of the phenomenon. ",
            "When inequality is high and growing rapidly, luxurious lifestyles are hard to ignore (Frank). ",
            "Moreover, money, in many cases, can easily be transformed into power in the US, as children are taught to be success-oriented since primary school. ",
            "Millions of relatively poor American citizens can still afford many things that nationals of many other states rarely even dream of. ",
            "Nevertheless, it is the inner sense of injustice and powerlessness that makes the perception of low income so painful for many.\n",
            "In the 1920s, the rapidly increased importance of wealth led to severe changes in culture and the social sphere in general. ",
            "For instance, a completely new literary genre that centers around the life of the rich became an immediate success. ",
            "One of the famous novels that provide a proper understanding of the atmosphere and the rapid shifts in social norms at that time is The Great Gatsby by F. ",
            "Scott Fitzgerald. ",
            "The author had first-hand experience communicating with a wide range of wealthy and influential people because of marrying a rich woman.\n",
            "The famous novelist provides valuable insights into the multiple psychological issues that plague the lives of the rich and make wealth acquisition a controversial goal. ",
            "F. ",
            "Scott Fitzgerald claims that the rich \u201csmashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made\u201d. ",
            "Moreover, the case of the protagonist clearly indicates that the original determination to acquire wealth is, in many cases, rooted in traumas and lack of attention.\n",
            "The growing disproportion in the distribution of wealth has numerous long-term consequences. ",
            "Parents\u2019 wealth plays an essential role in children\u2019s human capital accumulation (Hubmer et al., 2). ",
            "Therefore, millions of children are deprived of the chance to fully enjoy meritocracy, which has long been considered one of the US cornerstones. ",
            "The diminished importance of equal opportunities points to a structural problem in modern American society. ",
            "For instance, between 1978 and 2018, the share of wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent increased from 7 percent to 18 percent (Saez and Zucman, 4). ",
            "Therefore, it is crucial to find the proper means of redistributing wealth in a way that ensures the provision of high-quality healthcare services and education to all Americans.\n",
            "Current inequality rates stand behind the creation of an atmosphere that resembles that of the 1920s. ",
            "The majority of the population starts admiring the lifestyle of the incredibly rich instead of focusing on the multiple means available for the enhancement of their lives. ",
            "It is normal for a society to have a few Gatsbys that are ready to jump at every opportunity to get rich. ",
            "Nevertheless, the situation where millions of people believe that they have lost all life chances because of the non-stop extensive media coverage of the luxurious lifestyles of businessmen and celebrities is destructive for any society. ",
            "American Dream has not always been perceived by the majority as hoarding extreme riches. ",

            "One can argue that the short story \u201cWhere Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\u201d has a fitting open ending that both represents the mythical nature of the events occurring to Connie while also providing enough evidence to indicate what had happened to her. ",
            "On one end, the reader realizes that she was most likely murdered, as \u201cshe felt her breath start jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something Arnold Friend was stabbing her with again and again with no tenderness\u201d (Oates). ",
            "However, when Connie recovers consciousness, she is experiencing something like an out of body experience.\n",
            "It is obvious that she is dead and going into the afterlife, but it opens up numerous questions in the end as to who Arnold Friend really is, how is he all-knowing and seemingly omnipotent? ",
            "There is always the potential that it may be a dream, given that she went outside and could have fallen sleep knowing her tendency to daydream. ",
            "The open ending arises as to what is next for Connie and whether she is going into paradise, or just an illusion of it created by her killer. ",
            "Connie\u2019s spirit has seemingly changed from her physical appearance, but the audience is never given the full picture.\n",
            "One critical analysis by Samantha Conover suggests that Connie actually experienced an abduction and some form of rape or sexual assault. ",
            "The story does not directly portray this but potentially utilizes euphemisms and other literally devices to suggest that this powerful, rich man, that most likely stalked her was a sexual predator. ",
            "It is known that the short story was based by Oates on a real-life serial killer, who murdered several young girls before capture, suggesting a typology and type of sexual aggression demonstrated through his fulfillment when murdering his victims. ",
            "Connie\u2019s situation represents that of so many other women that have faced sexual assault, she knew the perpetrator but not closely, she was encountered alone, but in broad daylight, seemingly when no crime should occur. ",
            "Finally, her weakness and out-of-body experience could suggest that she simply was traumatized to the point of no longer having recognition of her own body (Conover 125). ",
            "It is a horrifying, but sadly accurate comparison drawn through imagery and metaphors in Oates story, indicating that it may not have been mythical at all, but an example of terrible realism.\n",

            "After the arrival of European colonialists, the indigenous people faced many challenges such as economic, political, and disruption of their tradition. ",
            "The aboriginal people lost their culture, land, and family without considering the extermination of European imperialism policies; they became enslaved by the Europeans. ",
            "During the colonial period, the indigenous people faced a high rate of discrimination, resulting in displacement since the colonial powers occupied a large part of the fertile lands, resulting in many deaths of indigenous communities. ",
            "For instance, over 200 languages the aboriginal people spoke lost value since the European colonialist did not recognize their culture. ",
            "Many families were forced out of their land, thus dispersing to other parts of Australia.\n",
            "The descendant of the aboriginal people should be recognized as one person since they share the bloodline, customs, and beliefs with their ancestors, who lived over 50000 years ago in the land. ",
            "Besides sharing cultural norms, the descendants can be classified as one people because they have a similar palace of origin: the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, East Timor, Singapore, and Indonesia located in the Southeast of Asia. ",
            "Therefore, they deserve equal rights like any other community, enabling them to protect their culture and heritage as one person.\n"

            "The spirit bear, also known as aka Kermode bear, is a unique creature that resides in British Columbia. ",
            "According to Groc (2020), this is the unique species of all bears not only because of its ice-cream-colored fur but also because of its location and rareness. ",
            "A single bear can weigh up to 200; knowing that bears generally possess from 80 to 600 kilograms, a maximum of two hundred seems to be low (Service, 2017). ",
            "The Kermode bear is the American black bear\u2019s subspecies, but what makes this animal so unusual is its recessive gene that colors the bears\u2019 fur white or creamy (National Geographic, 2017).\n",
            "The rareness of this species attracts additional interest in these bears \u2013 only 400 spirit bears currently live in British Columbia (Groc, 2020). ",
            "According to National Geographic (2017), their population locates in the Great Brain Rainforest, which represents a 6.4-million-hectare temperate rainforest and is a great environment for this species of animals. ",
            "In addition, this living area provides spirit bears with appropriate sustenance, such as salmon and a variety of berries, insects, plants, fruits, and nuts (Service, 2017). ",
            "Although the animal is massive, huge, and sometimes considered dangerous, it is shy and mysterious in nature; therefore, if not disturbed, the representative of this species poses no threat (Service, 2017). ",
            "However, the animal is considered dangerous only by tourists; according to Service (2017), indigenous populations see the spirit bear as sacred or holy mainly because of its unusual creamy color. ",
            "Based on the described characteristics, it can be concluded that spirit bears are some of the most unique and rare species on the planet; hence, they need to be protected and their environment preserved.\n"

            "Examining social changes occurring in the U.S. ",
            "at the beginning of the 20 th century, one must admit that the pace and scale gained by the feminist movement were by far among the most impressive ones. ",
            "By challenging social norms and accepted gender roles, American women transformed the perception of themselves in society, thus, redefining the gender dynamics within it. ",
            "When considering the legal regulations and policies that allowed for the described change, one must mention the 19 th Amendment to the U.S. ",
            "Constitution. ",
            "However, the process of enforcing the acceptance of the 19 th Amendment has not been linear and consistent, mainly due to the presence of racism and race-based prejudices in some states. ",
            "Though the early Suffrage movement lacked diversity and the associated perspectives, it did lay the foundation for the 19trh Amendment despite quite vocal claims against change among some of the more racist Tennessee women, who saw the regulation as the gateway to expanding the rights of African Americans.\n",
            "Remarkably, the arguments that renowned suffragettes introduced in their discussion of the 19 th Amendment varied significantly. ",
            "For instance, Belle Kearney, while supporting the liberation of women, focused primarily on White middle-class members, whereas Adella Hunt Logan actively promoted the emancipation of women of all races and ethnicities (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). ",
            "In turn, the perspective that Kearney offered was quite different from those of other prominent suffragettes. ",
            "For instance, Addams, who also actively encouraged the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the sociocultural and sociopolitical environment of the U.S., saw it mostly as a \u201cnatural extension of household duties\u201d (666). ",
            "Therefore, the interpretation of the significance of voting for women that Addams offered did not assign a particularly high value to the change.\n",
            "The specified idea of viewing the attainment of the right to vote could be seen as trivializing the tremendous change that the right to vote caused for female American citizens. ",
            "Therefore, Winslow\u2019s representation of the issue is understandably more popular since the latter insisted on the 19 th Amendment being the opportunity to address the tremendous injustice that American women had been suffering. ",
            "Specifically, Winslow referred to the change in question as the ethical and cultural awakening of the U.S. ",
            "Specifically, Winslow explains that significant alterations in the social dynamics are bound to happen once \u201cthe President realizes that brutal bullying isn\u2019t quite a statesmanlike method for setting a demand for justice at home\u201d (669). ",
            "Therefore, the perspectives on the subject matter varied significantly, yet the general idea of change was perceived as tremendously positive\n",
            "Unfortunately, not all women wholeheartedly supported the introduction of the 19 th Amendment into the American sociopolitical and sociocultural setting. ",
            "For instance, Tennessee women became quite infamous for their efforts to counteract the introduction of the Amendment and, effectively, ban it (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). ",
            "To dissect the nature of the described conflict, one should point to the presence of explicit racism within American society of the time (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). ",
            "According to Hewitt and Lawson (2019), Tennessee women assumed that the 19 th Amendment would become the gateway to African Americans, in general, receiving the right to vote, which Tennessee protesters considered inadmissible. ",
            "The protests of the Tennessee women signified major injustice within American society, proving the importance of the intersectionality of the feminist movement. ",
            "Specifically, to become a legitimate fight for equal rights and against sex-based oppression, the Suffragette movement had to include African American, Native American, and Latin American women, as well as women of any descent. ",
            "As a result, the significance of integration and support of African American women emerged, Logan being among the first ones to emphasize the problem directly (Hewitt and Lawson 2019).\n",
            "At the same time, one could argue that the suffragettes represented by the Tennessee women were in the minority. ",
            "Specifically, it is likely that prominent feminists of the time would have responded with indignation and the encouragement of supporting African American women, as well as women of other racial and ethnic minorities. ",
            "For example, Logan\u2019s arguments regarding the importance of supporting all women, including African American, Native American, and Latin American ones, should be mentioned (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). ",
            "Therefore, the focus on multiculturalism and intersectionality was quite prominent despite the presence of racism in the philosophies of some members of the movement.\n",
            "Finally, it would be wrong to separate the American Suffragette movement from the rest of social trends observed in the U.S. ",
            "community on the specified time slot. ",
            "Namely, the aspects of progressivism, such as the movement against segregation and the focus on the needs of the working class intersected with the Suffragette movement to a rather substantial extent (Hewitt and Lawson 2019). ",
            "Therefore, the sociocultural and sociopolitical changes observed in the U.S. ",
            "in the 1920s could be seen as a single progressive movement and positive force.\n",
            "While not being as inclusive due to the neglect of the specific needs of African American women and the lack of representation thereof in it, the U.S. ",
            "Suffragette movement of the 1920s created a platform for the further emancipation of American women. ",
            "However, the problem of racism and the resulting complications in advancing the regulation have proven the necessity of inclusivity and the essential principles of humanity to be seen as inseparable for feminism. ",
            "Namely, embracing the needs of all women and encouraging the interventionalist perspective, particularly, the union among women of all races, religious beliefs, and ethnic communities, has proven to be the critical focus of the feminist movement. ",
            "Thus, the described change has predetermined the evolution of the American Suffrage movement.\n",

            "Technical drawings can be described as plans that show how a human-made object is constructed. ",

            "Thus, it is vital for a technical drawing to follow its own universal language that can be recognized by all professionals ( Design Handbook , 2022). ",
            "For example, a mechanical engineering drawing shows a component or product\u2019s requirements (Singh and Singh, 2021). ",
            "It can also reveal weaknesses in the design and guide producers on how to manufacture it perfectly.\n",

            "Another field where technical drawings are essential is architecture. ",
            "Sketches and diagrams are also necessary for healthcare and software engineering (Vergara et al., 2021). ",
            "Historically, technical drawings were drafted by hand, using tools (Maguire, Phelps and Simmons, 2020). ",
            "These included a drafting table, a straightedge, T-square, compass, and more. ",

            "To draw a first-angle projection, one can imagine that the object is placed between the person drawing and the projection (fig. ",
            "4). ",
            "Therefore, the product is placed above the horizontal plane and in front of the vertical plane, and the projection plays the role of paper (Rahbarianyazd and Nia, 2019). ",
            "As a result, the observer sees through the object. ",
            "To distinguish the first angle projection, technical drawings are marked with a specific symbol (fig. ",
            "4).\n",
            "Figure 4: First-degree projection\n",
            "Third Angle\n",
            "The third angle projection imagines the object and the diagram differently. ",
            "This projection theory is used mainly in the United States and has a specific marking (fig. ",
            "5). ",
            "One can describe the drawing as if the object were put in a clear box or behind a transparent wall. ",
            "This is the projection \u2013 it is placed between the observer and the detail being drawn (fig. ",
            "5). ",
            "On the technical drawing, the object is in the third quadrant, and the other views are placed in the first and second ones (Rahbarianyazd and Nia, 2019). ",
            "It is imagined that the object is situated behind the vertical and below the horizontal plane. ",
            "As a result, the engineer sees the side and top of the object the same way they are depicted on the drawing.\n",
            "Figure 5: Third-degree projection\n",
            "Axonometric (Pictorial)\n",
            "While objects\u2019 views are separated into sides in orthographic projections, axonometric projections display the plan, front, and side views in one drawing. ",
            "This provides more visualization but a less clear representation of dimensions than an orthographic projection. ",
            "As all three views are put into one illustration, the axes of the objects\u2019 bodies have to be changed (foreshortened) according to the perspective that the observer assumes (Bi and Wang, 2020). ",
            "For example, when one looks at a detail from one of its axes at an angle, some sides appear shorter than they are in real life (fig. ",
            "6). ",
            "There are three categories of axonometric projection: dimetric, isometric, and trimetric, based on the three axes of projection.\n",
            "Figure 6: An axonometric projection\n",
            "Dimetric\n",
            "The differences between the projections are based on the ways in which axes are changed in relation to each other. ",
            "In a dimetric projection, two of the three axes are foreshortened equally, and the third axis\u2019 foreshortening is scaled separately (fig. ",
            "7). ",
            "Therefore, one side is more distorted than the two others, which leads to the drawing being more approximate than precise (Tornincasa, 2020). ",
            "A dimetric projection does not have a strict angle at which it is used \u2013 the observer determines it. ",
            "However, as two axes are scaled in the same way, some knowledge of measurements is necessary to represent the object. ",
            "Dimetric projection is not the most commonly utilized method as it requires complex angle calculations and approximation of the third axis\u2019 scaling.\n",
            "Figure 7: Dimetric projections\n",
            "Isometric\n",
            "Isometric projections are more common in technical drawings than in other axonometric types. ",
            "In this projection, all three axes are foreshortened the same amount (fig. ",
            "8). ",
            "Therefore, there is a standard angle of 120\u00b0 between all axes \u2013 this angle separates the whole projection into three equal parts (Tornincasa, 2020). ",
            "This approach is also the easiest to work with, as one can use simple tools to construct a technical drawing. ",
            "In isometric projections, all axes change equally, which means that no approximations have to be made. ",
            "These characteristics of isometric drawings make them the most reliable and precise out of all axonometric projections. ",
            "They are also helpful for the design element of engineering, depicting a 3D object as it could be seen in real life.\n",
            "Figure 8: An isometric projection\n",
            "Types of Lines and Their Use\n",
            "Lines in a technical drawing can be continuous, dashed, or chain; the thickness of lines is important as well as their form (fig. ",
            "9). ",
            "There are ten mainline types that can be used in a technical drawing. ",
            "The first type is a continuous thick line that represents the visual outlines of an object (Saif, 2021). ",
            "A thin continuous line can note an imaginary, dimension, or projection line (Saif, 2021). ",
            "For example, if a drawn detail is a part of a larger product, thin lines can help place it in the structure.\n",
            "Figure 9: A technical drawing with different lines\n",
            "Zig-zag and wavy (freehand) lines denote the object\u2019s boundaries, limits, and breaks (Saif, 2021). ",
            "Dashed lines usually depict outlines and edges that appear hidden in the chosen view, as if the detail were transparent (Saif, 2021). ",
            "The last category of mainline types is chain lines, where short and long dashes are combined. ",
            "For example, a thin chain line represents the lines of symmetry in an object as well as the center and trajectory of the drawing (Saif, 2021). ",
            "A thick chain line can denote the area or specific line that requires a different treatment.\n",
            "Scaling\n",
            "It is clear that not all details can be drawn to their full size. ",
            "For this reason, all technical drawings are drawn to a specific scale for producers to build the object according to its true dimensions (Tornincasa, 2020). ",
            "For example, a full-scale drawing means that the diagram and the detail have the same measurements (such as length, width, and other parameters) (fig. ",
            "10). ",
            "Smaller objects can be scaled up \u2013 all numbers being multiplied by the same number to draw the detail larger than it is in reality. ",
            "In the same way, large products are scaled down in a technical drawing.\n",
            "Figure 10: An example of scaling\n",
            "Many types of scale exist, according to the drawing\u2019s purpose and the measurement system used in the project. ",
            "For instance, large objects (such as aircraft) have to be significantly scaled, where 1 inch can represent up to 100 feet (Tornincasa, 2020). ",
            "There is also a metric-based scaling system, where one millimeter is used as the base measurement ( Design Handbook , 2022). ",
            "Here, a small detail can be drawn on a 2:1 scale (2 millimeters of a drawing for 1 millimeter in real life), while a 1:50 scale can help illustrate large objects.\n",
            "Dimensioning\n",
            "While the visual representation of detail is important, it cannot be used in production without knowing its actual measurements. ",
            "Thus, another critical part of the drawing process is dimensioning \u2013 the addition of size information ( Design Handbook , 2022). ",
            "A well-dimensioned and described part can be easily rebuilt as the drawing contains all the needed data ( Design Handbook , 2022). ",
            "However, it is vital to dimension the object properly so that all numbers are easily interpreted by manufacturers (fig. ",
            "11).\n",
            "Figure 11: An example of dimensioning\n",
            "For that reason, dimensioning also follow the universal rules of technical drawing. ",
            "The numerical value (dimension) is placed near the dimension lines that show the extent of the size (Maguire, Phelps and Simmons, 2020). ",
            "An arrow is placed at the ends of these lines to show where the dimensioned line ends (Maguire, Phelps and Simmons, 2020). ",
            "Together, these elements create a clear representation of each part of the object. ",
            "Furthermore, a drawing can also include tolerance \u2013 a number to which the dimension can vary ( Design Handbook , 2022). ",
            "Also, some drawings can feature limits of the size that represent the maximum and minimum measurements for the specific detail (Maguire, Phelps and Simmons, 2020). ",
            "The addition of these elements depends on each particular drawing.\n",
            "Auxiliary Views, Sections, and Sectional Views\n",
            "An auxiliary view is an additional view that is necessary when an object\u2019s plan, front, and side perspectives are not enough. ",
            "For example, if a detail has an inclined surface, it may not fully appear on a simple orthographic projection (Singh and Singh, 2021). ",
            "For this reason, an auxiliary view of this particular surface and its connection to the figure is added to the drawing (Singh and Singh, 2021). ",
            "It should be noted that the auxiliary view is represented on the drawing following its perspective \u2013 it is placed perpendicular to the angle where the unseen surface is shown from the side (fig. ",
            "12).\n",
            "Figure 12: An auxiliary view\n",
            "Some details cannot be reproduced without knowing how they are structured on the inside. ",
            "Here, one may use a section or a sectional view of the object (fig. ",
            "13). ",
            "It is a look inside the detail as if it were cut and opened up (Singh and Singh, 2021). ",
            "A sectional view usually shows an object cut in half, and special lines show the symmetry and center of the object to signify the cut\u2019s location (Singh and Singh, 2021). ",
            "In most cases, the material is also indicated with shading to show the hollow parts of the detail.\n",

            "The usual applications of these technologies are in the field of data management, product visualization, and training; however, there is infinite potential in their development and integration with one another \u2013 and this is why they are important today.\n",
            "Generally, CAD systems are used in visualization, prototyping, and understanding functions of a concept \u2013 they in great demand in architecture, product design, and engineering. ",
            "According to Gao et al., their team used a CAD system to help to design a museum exhibition more efficiently (157). ",
            "Since this process implies knowledge application from a great number of fields, such as \u201clandscape architecture, audiovisual engineering, and digital media,\u201d mistakes are likely to happen. ",
            "With CAD, which allows testing the project, these mistakes are easier to spot and get rid of at an early stage. ",

            "In this case, blockchain can be extremely helpful with its capabilities to provide security of information. ",
            "Since its primary characteristic is that information, once published, cannot be altered, every member can verify any action (Lemes & Lemes 25). ",

            "Theories of computer-mediated communications (CMC) focus on how people learn to use them as active agents. ",
            "This approach is different from the debates in terms of positive and negative aspects of the computer medium, which puts a human into a passive role. ",
            "Research by Sherblom et al. ",
            "examined the cognitive influences of knowledge, motivation, apprehension, skill, and medium on student participation in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments (34). ",
            "In particular, the researchers attempted to clarify which influence has the most power over the students\u2019 willingness to participate in CSCL discussions.\n",
            "The researchers combined two main approaches to CMC competence analysis to achieve those goals. ",
            "The first approach identified participants\u2019 knowledge and motivation as the primary influences, while the second focused on affective predispositions such as apprehension and reticence. ",
            "CMC apprehension determines an overall negative perception towards text-based communication, and reticence describes anxiety emerging during the use of CMC to express emotions and personal meanings (Sherblom et al., 33). ",
            "After defining these factors of influence, the researchers conducted a questionnaire-based qualitative analysis of the control group.\n",
            "During the first stage, 91 participants completed an anonymous online survey that queried their self-perception of the following factors: CMC knowledge, motivation, skill, apprehension, medium, and degree of participation in CSCL discussions. ",
            "After completion of the data collection stage, the items loading of six factors were entered into a linear regression analysis that produced a regression model. ",
            "That model provided a clear representation of influence, contributed to participation in CSCL discussions by each factor.\n",
            "The study showed that knowledge of the CMC medium was the strongest influence on participation with a \u03b2=.41. ",
            "Perceived skill occupied second place in terms of importance with a \u03b2=.23. ",
            "Apprehension has also contributed to negative participation with a \u03b2= -.17 score. ",
            "Motivation \u2014 an overall reliance and trust in CMC, took fourth place with a \u03b2=.11. ",
            "Finally, the influence of the CMC medium showed little to no contribution with a \u03b2=.01 score.\n",
            "In regard to limitations, one should realize that the study included quite a small sample of participants. ",
            "Due to that fact, it would be wrong to claim that researchers confirmed a universal rule. ",
            "Despite this limitation, the study contains practical value since it provides an insight that can be examined in other classrooms or bigger groups of participants. ",
            "In addition to that, teachers can use the results of this study to improve students\u2019 experience with CSCL.\n",
            "In a broader sense, the study\u2019s findings can improve the quality of learning in an online format. ",
            "For example, the revealed importance of knowledge shows that instructors need to pay attention to students\u2019 training before engaging them in online discussions. ",
            "The relatively small scope of research created certain limitations; however, the study still highlighted weak spots that hinder the use of technology for educational purposes.\n",
            "In general, the study did a decent job at revealing problems that emerge during online communication in an educational setting. ",
            "Society still faces troubles created by seemingly endless waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
            "In that regard, it is impossible to predict whether education will return to the usual format, or teachers and students will have to master online communication because it will stay relevant for a long time. ",
            "If the latter becomes the case, the awareness about CMC and CSCL will grow in importance, changing the face of education in the long perspective.\n",
            "Finally, I would like to commend the paper for clarity in research methods and result presentation. ",
            "This study is not difficult to comprehend not only for education system professionals but also for the students. ",
            "I especially approve that researchers provided practical suggestions on solving problems related to such issues like the lack of CMC knowledge or CMC apprehension. ",

            "As a company producing computer servers, Super Micro was found guilty of improper financial accounting by the securities and the exchange commission. ",
            "In the FY 2015 through to 2017, the company engaged in fraudulent deals breaching a number of sections of securities act of 1933. ",
            "The company prematurely recognized revenue and deliberately misstated financial statements amounting to grievous violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n",
            "Poor internal control was widely witnessed as employees were pushed to maximize revenue and minimize expenses. ",
            "Goods were delivered to the customers before due dates as stipulated in the terms and in the process undermining generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (Larkin and DiTommaso 391). ",
            "Through its employees, the company illegally changed shipment terms, delivered incomplete goods, and held the bill of lading abusing the rights of its carriers. ",
            "Due to these gross violations, the security and exchange commission delivered cease-and-desist injunction barring the company from conducting some of its activities. ",
            "Although the super micro has been fined $ 19.5 million, a detailed audit should be carried out to ascertain the extent of fraud.\n",
            "Before commencing the audit process, auditor should first understand the client, the kind of business being conducted, and the accounting process. ",
            "An audit company needs to draw a comprehensive strategy audit plan that would be used in the whole process. ",
            "The accuracy of accounting system including internal control structure being used by the company in question should be verified. ",
            "The nature of audit to be employed must be decided on earlier enough.\n",
            "Generally, auditor is simply an expert of financial matters. ",
            "However, when faced with complex scenarios like in the case of Super Micro which deals with computer technologies, the auditor may require services of a specialist. ",
            "According to auditing standards (AS 1210) of the PCAOB, a specialist is an individual with special skills and knowledge in a given field (Krishnan et al. ",
            "153). ",
            "To obtain correct evidential matter from the substantive tests while evaluating the books and technological property of Super Micro, the help of a specialist would be of great significance.\n",
            "In the case of Super Micro, it would not be appropriate to design tests on the financial statements assertions provided by the company. ",
            "The firm has inadequate internal control system and fundamental financial reporting is not done. ",
            "This can be supported by the fact that it presented wrong financial statements on net sales to the securities and the exchange commission, and was forced to alter them. ",
            "The company does not keep proper financial records to avoid backlash from its employees who have in some occasions tried to expose some of its dealings. ",
            "The risks of material mistreatments are higher since a number of its employees engage in fraudulent acts by threatening customers and carriers through personal emails to accomplish company demands. ",
            "Therefore, the auditing team should carry out its own substantive audit tests to help in exposing the fraud being practiced in the firm.\n",
            "The internal control tests that should be adopted include inspection of all the documents such as payrolls, deliveries, and invoices. ",
            "Approvals in terms of signatures, stamps, and check marks should be inspected to assess any illegal dealings. ",
            "Observations of internal controls that are used by the firm and their effectiveness must be made. ",
            "According to PCAOB, transactions should be traced from the origin to their inclusion in the financial statements (DeFond et al. ",
            "593). ",
            "The control element on the business should be put into perspective. ",
            "This is due to the fact that in some cases recognition of revenue is done upon shipment of goods without customer authorization, prior to delivery, before obtaining customer acceptance, and sometimes with incomplete or damaged shipments.\n",
            "Communication records are some of the pieces of evidence that can be used to detect any illegal practices in an organization. ",
            "To evaluate such, direct communications between third party and Super Micro should be assessed. ",
            "This can be done through designing confirmation requests and sending them to the other stakeholders involved in the business. ",
            "The main aim would be to obtain information about particular items affecting financial assertions. ",
            "According to AICPA auditing standards, upon establishment of confirmations, they can be sent to the third parties and feedbacks evaluated (Swieringa 128). ",
            "If evidence obtained is inadequate, more confirmations can be sent.\n",
            "In the case of Super Micro, validations can be sent to the carriers and customers whose rights have been infringed by the firm through illegal financial practices. ",
            "Shipment processes between the company and some of its customers were marred with irregularities as they could in some occasions be threatened by employees through emails to accept goods when they do not need them. ",
            "A number of goods could be hoarded in carriers\u2019 stores against their will. ",
            "Such information can be obtained through sending confirmations.\n",
            "Comparison of account estimates would prove crucial to ascertain all evidential matters are material to financial statements developed by the firm. ",
            "It would also ensure approximations are reasonable and records of the company\u2019s business operations are true. ",
            "It would also help to establish if all estimations conform to the GAAP and Securities Exchange principles. ",
            "Changes of principles in the industry are always disregarded by the organizations in the business.\n",
            "As such, their methods of operation should be evaluated to ensure they conform to the new accounting pronouncements. ",
            "According to AS 2110, an accounting estimate should be conducted to ensure new entries in the industry adhere to the operating strategies (Acito et al. ",
            "15). ",
            "The comparison of industry\u2019s estimates and super micro\u2019s would be significant to ensure new entries which are conducting business with the firm are following the rules. ",
            "Pursuant to AS 2505, comparisons should be done to check any form of litigation claims. ",
            "Such information would enable the auditing team to assess damages or infringements by the firm.\n",
            "Lastly, to ensure all the Super Micro\u2019s financial statements and supporting documents are valid, complete, accurate, and without errors, some substantive tastings must be conducted. ",
            "Confirmations should be sent to the banks requesting accounting records of end cash balances. ",
            "Accounts receivable balances for the costumers must be verified to ensure they are correct. ",
            "Super Micro in most cases failed to update its inventory records; therefore, it would be suitable to evaluate the period-end physical inventory count. ",
            "A specialist should verify if the values of all the assets are reasonable and conform to the market prices. ",
            "The records of fixed assets should be substantiated to check if they match physical possessions. ",
            "Loan balances should be ascertained by the lenders as well as approved dividends.\n",

            "It is important to note that this platform is more than a report card. ",
            "In the old way of doing things, the students had no idea how they earned a particular grade. ",

            "In the past, students did not have a realistic assessment of the knowledge acquisition process. ",
            "However, with the use of the Gradebook, students are empowered to have the capability to figure out areas that require improvement.\n",
            "The Announcements are one of the features of the online learning platform that serves as a one-stop-area for students that need to get informed regarding key activities, requirements, and events. ",
            "In the past, students complained about the lack of access to critical information related to the course. ",
            "It was a common problem to have instructors or professors thinking about doing an activity or cancelling an event and the absence of the appropriate tool. ",

            "In the course of the semester, students are expected to work within teams and with other members of the class. ",
            "They are supposed to work on projects or class presentations. ",
            "Due to the hectic schedule and other pressing matters of different types of academic requirements it is easy to lose track of the developments of a specific project. ",
            "However, the use of email allows the students to have the capability of storing important information. ",
            "For example, in the process of dealing with a project the articles that were downloaded or the ideas that were shared during a recent brainstorming session are stored within the servers that are part of the said email system. ",
            "If there is a need to review a certain key idea, the student simply has to scroll up and down the list of emails received. ",

            "Aside from using different tools that allow the learner to access information via the World-Wide-Web or video sharing platforms, Live Chat provides the ability to contact another person. ",
            "As a result, there is a way to tailor-fit the knowledge acquisition process. ",
            "For example, in a video that is uploaded to a video-sharing platform, the student watching the video is simply the audience. ",
            "He or she simply accepts or receives the video presentation. ",
            "Although this is a good way of acquiring important information regarding a particular subject matter, there is little interaction that occurs in that medium. ",
            "However, in Live Chat the student can fire back with a question. ",
            "The great thing about Live Chat is that the person on the other end also has the capacity to interact with the students using the said tool.\n",
            "Live Chat creates the feeling of limitless learning because students and teachers are no longer constrained by the limitations created by time and space. ",

            "Use this feature everyday to track changes and weak points. ",
            "With just one glance the student using the said tool receives feedback regarding the learning activities that he or she had completed in the past. ",
            "There is an automatic validation of a good work that has been logged in and deemed completed. ",
            "However, if there are problems with completion, then the Intellipath system also provides a gentle reminder on the unfinished tasks that require greater attention. ",
            "Aside from the tracking process, the great thing about the Intellipath system is the interactive nature of the system. ",
            "One of the impressive features is the ability of the system to provide a certain measurement value regarding the student\u2019s mastery of a certain area of learning. ",
            "The system has the capability to provide the forecast of the skill and knowledge acquisition ability of the student. ",

            "The Learning Materials feature of the online learning system provides an easy-access location for all the pertinent information required to master a particular course. ",
            "It also helps students to plan their pace because the materials are made available all at once. ",
            "In the absence of the Learning Materials feature, students are at the mercy of the instructors. ",
            "If there are instructors that are not prudent enough to provide advanced notification regarding the progress of the class learning process, the students are limited by that trickling flow of information. ",
            "However, with the introduction of the Learning Materials feature students are able to develop their own pace with regards to how they are going to spend time and resources in studying the said materials.\n",
            "Using the Learning Materials feature is like having an interactive map that provides directions which way to go and what subject areas require immediate attention. ",
            "Use this feature when studying specific topics.\n",
            "The MUSE is an acronym and it stands for My Unique Student Experience. ",
            "This means that the university created a platform that understands and appreciates the uniqueness of each enrollee. ",

            "There is no other term to describe the MUSE platform other than the term personalization. ",
            "This system is a testament to how the educational system has acknowledged the unique capabilities of each learner. ",
            "It is not prudent to force students to simply learn by reading and going over a text-based knowledge acquisition strategy. ",
            "There are students that are going to respond better if they are able to have access to videos or exercises that allow them to manipulate objects. ",
            "This reminds the proponent of this presentation about the ancient way of learning that was espoused by the ancient Greek philosophers. ",
            "It is already a tremendous revelation to find out that teachers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle did not find it wise to simply limit the learner\u2019s experience within the four walls of a classroom. ",
            "These Greek philosophers encouraged movement of the students as they walked together or went to certain locations in order to ponder some of the most difficult questions about life. ",
            "In the present time, the use of the MUSE acknowledges the need to go beyond the confines of conventional learning environment.\n",
            "The creators of the MUSE platform developed an interactive learning environment. ",
            "At the same time, students are able to access different tools and materials that suit their learning styles and learning requirements. ",
            "It is a good thing to know that the university invested in a proprietary system that enables students to see a particular subject matter from different perspectives. ",
            "There is a need to look into this system and how the students are able to capitalize on this tool. ",

            "The most significant technological advancement witnessed in the 20th century was the expansion of World Wide Web in the 1990s. ",
            "This resulted in the interconnectedness of millions of computers and other pages of information worldwide (Masrek et al. ",
            "199). ",
            "Additionally, it was very cheap to share information across the globe. ",
            "The introduction of laptops and other portable devices that replaced the desktop computer indicated that there was an influx of mobile wireless connections across the globe (Masrek et al. ",
            "199). ",
            "With time the mobile phones and palmtops were included in the list of easy to move around and accessible networks. ",
            "The wireless developments in the society have in addition greatly improved from the advent of these technologies.\n",
            "The 21st century has witnessed a wide range of usage of wireless devices especially due to portability. ",
            "This is attributed to the fact that the design of wireless devices does not emphasize on heavy computation and overly secure communication but it is often treated as add-ons (Peng & Sushil 45). ",
            "Additional limitations such as shared medium have attracted a large number of users to wireless networks. ",
            "Security procedures such as the jamming attack are difficult to detect and yet very easy to initiate (Peng & Sushil 45).\n",
            "Smith and Caputi (265) note that wireless networks are very cheap and thus are getting used in many modalities currently. ",
            "Their uses range from the wireless local area networks to mesh and other sensor networks. ",
            "As such, their range is wide making the provision of security and trustworthiness a critical issue. ",
            "Generally, wireless networks are open in nature and are constructed on shared mediums, thus the provision of secure networks is very difficult in such instances (Peng & Sushil 45). ",
            "An outsider can for instance interrupt a communication from taking place. ",
            "This can be done by sending constant and other bogus messages that are periodically sent for collision purposes in the network. ",
            "The bogus messages later lead to increased back off at the node level and other multiple transmissions of data. ",
            "A jammer for instance can be referred to as a wireless device that produces radio interference attacks on a wireless network (Peng & Sushil 48).\n",
            "The main idea behind a jammer is to block wireless connections and keep the medium solely for itself or deform a valid communication that is going on (Peng & Sushil 48). ",
            "This goal can be successfully accomplished by warding off the traffic source of information from sending out packet data or by thwarting the reception of legitimate data packages. ",
            "This process, just like hacking, is meant to retrieve information from an authorized user to unauthorized users. ",
            "There are many jamming approaches and strategies that can be used by an attacker to disrupt communication. ",
            "The most common is the time-based strategy, where the jamming signal is active and occurs in specified time (Smith & Caputi 268). ",
            "Other more advanced schemes in jamming use the knowledge of the physical and layer specifications of the target system. ",
            "Thus jamming is carried out by eliminating some radio frequency signal in the target system (Smith & Caputi 268). ",
            "Jamming can however be effectively tackled by the PHY-layer communication techniques; which are based on spreading techniques, for instance the Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). ",
            "The installation of such systems ensures that the suppleness of the system is maintained (Smith & Caputi 270).\n",
            "Advancements in computer science have made it possible for companies such as banks to lose billions through electronic fund transfers, which the culprits use via undetected bank systems. ",
            "Additionally, through wireless communications, terrorists have been able to carry out their main targets. ",
            "For instance in the 9/11 attacks, the supposed culprits purchased their air tickets through the undetected online system of the airport. ",
            "Hacking, the unprofessional act of assessing unauthorized data has been possible through advancements in technology. ",
            "As such, it has led to many problems for the international community, most notably emanating from the leaked messages from the United States government following their release by Julian Assange. ",
            "Thus, many computer engineers have proposed the Mobility Oriented Trust system (MOTS) that makes use of the trust table by incorporating a trust node in each cable (Murgolo-Poore et al. ",
            "175).\n",
            "Wireless communications where wireless management systems are installed can greatly improve the effectiveness and ease in the application of multiple procedures in an organization. ",
            "Murgolo-Poore and colleagues add that the output of the various procedures when in good form increases productivity (179). ",
            "Many organizations have thus transcribed to the wireless connections and the technology is greatly growing, assisted with the advancements in computer science. ",
            "The concept of trust is very vital in communication and in the development of net work protocol designers, especially where the main intent is to establish a trust relationship in the participating nodes (Murgolo-Poore et al. ",
            "175). ",
            "The latter allows for collaborative use of the system\u2019s metrics. ",
            "Trust however, as noted, is built if interactions between users have been faithful. ",
            "In any wireless network, trust is very fundamental and it can be defined as the degree of belief about the behavior of other entities and in most cases it is context \u2013 based. ",
            "For instance one can be trusted as an expert in car fixing but not in network installations.\n",

            "Technological innovation is always at the forefront of computer component technology with advances in production and development resulting in faster, better and lighter products (Bursky, 26). ",
            "These changes can be seen with the improved memory capacities inherent in today\u2019s hard disk systems, the increased processing power of processors, new innovations in disk drive technology which enable greater media storage capacities as well as new technologies enabling better component cooling (Bursky, 26). ",
            "It must be noted though that not all technological innovations are actually inherently adoptable by the general population. ",
            "For example, during the late 1990\u2019s and early 2001 one of the latest innovations in external storage methods was the development of the ZIP drive. ",
            "Back then it was thought of as a revolutionary concept in external storage however it was never truly adapted by the general population due to subsequent advances in driver technology which enabled people to burn information onto CDs. ",
            "Nicholas Carr in his article, \u201cIT doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, which examines the use of technologies and their implications on society explains that technologies and their widespread use only become cheaper once they reach their build out completion. ",

            "Carr explains that so long as certain forms of technology have not reached a point of build out completion they will most likely never be adopted due to their prohibitive costs and the uncertainty attached to the technology itself. ",
            "This particular lesson can be seen in the case of ZIP drive technology wherein the uncertainty behind its use led to it never being adequately adopted by the general population. ",
            "It is based on this that it can be assumed that not all technological innovations will actually be adopted by the general population and this includes several of the new innovations currently being released in the market today. ",
            "For example, the advent of 3D computer screens is heralded by many as a possible new standard to computer viewing yet industry data shows that not only is its usage unwieldy for the average user it serves no purpose for normal computer tasks such as using word processing software or utilizing the internet. ",
            "When trying to determine what the future holds for computer component technology the manufacturing process itself should also be taken into consideration. ",
            "Lately various consumer report groups have stated that certain PC component shave increasingly been found to actually be designed to eventually break down due to inferior materials being used. ",
            "Such a case is actually quite true in the case of certain components whose operational lives are limited to only a few years and are not meant to last more than 4 years of continuous usage at most. ",
            "The reason behind this lies with changes in the method of production wherein components are no longer being built to last but rather are being built with the current pace of innovations and consumer demands for cheap components. ",
            "While current trends in various computer innovations may seem like the future of computer component technology it should not be assumed that they will actually attain the status of general utilization since various factors such as consumer adaptability and their inherent build out completion need to be taken into account.\n",

            "This translates into greater durability over the long term as compared to parts that would use cheaper forms of metal and lighter materials. ",
            "In comparison computer components today are made of far lighter materials which do translate into better heat and electrical conductivity however this also makes them far more prone to break down as compared to parts constructed out of heavier materials. ",

            "The reasoning behind this lies with the fact that with the current rate of technological innovation building parts to last does not make as much sense as it used to since components are replaced with newer models and types on an almost yearly basis. ",
            "More durable components translate into greater production costs which results in higher component prices. ",

            "In effect durability no longer holds as much sway as it used to due to the current fast paced advances in technological innovation which almost ensures that public companies or private individuals replace their various computer components before they break down. ",
            "Another factor to take into consideration is the fact that a majority of consumer buying behavior is geared more towards acquiring the latest parts rather than the most durable. ",
            "Not only that, various studies examining consumer buying behaviors show that more consumers buy components on the basis of their low prices as compared to determining whether a particular component is durable or not. ",

",
            "This process usually involves a metal plate directly being attached to a particular component with a set of metal attachments being connected directly to fans from which the heat is dissipated via cool air being circulated directly to the component through the fan system (EDN, 16). ",

            "While fan systems are effective in bringing cold air into various systems they are actually ineffective in keeping temperatures low within casings over a prolonged period of time. ",
            "In fact, over a certain period of time fan systems fail to keep temperatures within nominal levels for proper operation and this often leads to parts breaking down earlier than they should due to the high temperatures within the casing that the fans are unable to effectively control. ",
            "This often leads to burned out components, sudden computer shut downs and a variety of other results normally associated with such ineffective systems for cooling. ",
            "One method that companies have utilized in order to resolve this particular issue has been to constantly keep the areas where a number of systems are located under a particular temperature through various air conditioning units. ",
            "While this particular method of resolving growing PC temperatures is effective in the short term the fact remains that in the long term such a method of temperature control is costly and as such an alternative means of resolving this particular problem is needed. ",
            "In the past 5 years one of the growing alternatives to resolving the heating problem of PC\u2019s has been to utilize liquid cooling systems as a replacement for traditional fan cooling systems (Goldsborough, 30). ",
            "Liquid cooling systems utilize a series of tubes containing a mixture of distilled water and various coolants which circulate towards a cooling plate directly attached to the component producing heat (Upadhya and Rebarber, 22). ",
            "Heat exchange occurs when cool water from the system hits the heat sink and absorbs the heat transferring it away from the system via the serious of tubes towards a radiator that expels the heat and cools down the water (Upadhya and Rebarber, 22). ",
            "Unlike conventional fan systems liquid cooling can reduce heat up to 60 percent better and produces far less sound resulting in better component longevity and better long term performance from a PC (Upadhya and Rebarber, 22). ",
            "It must be noted though that liquid cooling systems utilize more electricity compared to traditional fan cooling systems due to the use of both a pump and a radiator in order to dissipate the heat that and such systems are also more maintenance oriented due to the necessity of checking the coolant levels in order to ensure that there is enough liquid coolant to make the system work popular. ",
            "Unfortunately, the utilization of liquid cooling systems over most of the current consumer market is still isolated to a few select groups such as gamers, graphics artists and variety of other users that utilize systems with high core temperatures. ",

            "As of late though, the advances in driver technology have slowly updated the technology from initially allowing consumers to burn information onto a CD-rom disk to eventually allowing them to watch and burn DVDs. ",
            "The latest incarnation of the technological advances in driver technology have resulted in the creation of the Blu-ray disk format enabling consumers to store up to 30 to 40 gigabytes of data onto a single disk (Digtial Content, 39). ",
            "The creation of Blu-ray disk technology actually follows a distinct trend in driver technology wherein every few years drivers and disks are created that have higher storage capacities, faster speeds, better video resolution quality and an assortment of added functions that surpasses the previous generation.

            "Based on this trend in advances for this particular aspect of computer component technology it can be assumed that Blu-ray disk technology will not be the final version of disk drive technology rather it is merely another evolutionary level (Perenson, 94). ",
            "In fact disk production companies such as Philips, Sony, Maxwell, TDK, Optware and Panasonic have already announced a new potentially new form of media consumption in the form of the HVD disk which is slated for release in the next few years. ",

            "While various manufacturers are advocating that they should be (they get to charge higher prices for memory sticks with heat sinks) the fact remains that based on future methods of cooling such as the use of mineral oil and liquid cooling it cannot be said that the current trend in the utilization of heat sinks in memory sticks will continue into the future especially when liquid cooling or mineral oil technology reaches their respective build out completion times and become commercially viable.\n",
            "The Push towards Miniaturization and Holograms\n",
            "One of the most recent trends in the development of PC components has been a distinct push towards miniaturization with various components decreasing in size and weight as consumers demand more portability in the devices they use. ",
            "This has given rise to products such Intel\u2019s Atom processor, more efficient miniature laptop batteries and a host of other innovations all aimed at making PC components smaller and thus more easily carried by the average consumer (Murphy, 113). ",
            "In fact it can even be said that this apparent push towards miniaturization is a trend that will continue far into the future with holographic technology taking precedent in future portable devices such as net books and laptops. ",
            "The reason why holographic technology is being stated is due to the fact that one of the latest developments in holographic technology has been the utilization of credit card sized keyboard that uses infrared technology to identify the positioning of a user\u2019s fingers to in effect create the simulation of interaction between a user and a holographic image (Issei et al., 32 \u2013 34). ",
            "While this particular type of technology is still a decade or two away from actual commercialization it must be noted that this in effect could become the future of all input devices (Gomes, 40). ",
            "Holograms can be described as 3d images created through various output projection sources to create the illusion of volume. ",
            "For example one of the current applications of the technology has been the creation of \u201cvocaloid\u201d concerts in Japan wherein a projected holographic image is created on stage to simulate an actual person singing in a concert. ",
            "Unfortunately, while input technologies involving infrared light can be currently utilized holographic technology is still within its infancy. ",
            "The fact is creating an effective 3d hologram requires a significant amount of energy as well as a self contained projection apparatus that can project the necessary image onto a black screen or onto a particular space template. ",
            "With the current push towards miniaturization it cannot be feasibly stated that holographic technology can utilized as a portable medium within the next few years. ",
            "Various studies examining the rate of development of holographic technology specifically state that it will require at least another 20 years before the technology becomes applicable for commercial purposes. ",
            "One of the reasons behind this is connected to the fact that the development of holographic display technology is mostly being conducted by research labs in various universities and not by any significant commercial company that produces various forms of display technology. ",
            "Companies such as AOC, VGA, LG and Asus are focusing their efforts more on traditional methods of display technology such as LCD screens rather than conceptual technologies that have yet to actually attain proper conceptualization (Gonsalves, 6). ",
            "What must be understood is that companies are more or less profit oriented and as such they will not expend resources on developing a product that is still in the theoretical stage (Gonsalves, 6). ",
            "While it may be true that holograms may be the wave of the future for display utilized in computers the fact remains that until the technology actually proves itself commercially feasible it is unlikely that companies will allocate any amount of resources towards the development of the technology.\n",

            "Databases are components of Information Systems that are used when the Information Systems have large amounts of a, especially when the interfaces in the Information System are interactive, and when users can access the system concurrently. ",
            "The use of databases in such a scenario, therefore, ensures that information is available to users in real-time, and that system performance bottlenecks are minimized due to appropriate data management. ",
            "There is a variety of databases from which an organization can choose. ",
            "The choice of the database application depends on the volume of data that a particular Management Information System will be handling. ",
            "For Management Information Systems handling large volumes, it is advisable to use heavy database applications like Microsoft SQL or Oracle. ",
            "While for Management Information Systems that handle small volumes of data, light databases like MySQL are appropriate. ",
            "This paper is an analysis of the database applications used in my school.\n",
            "In my school, we perform tasks that do not require the use of an Information System using the Microsoft Access database. ",
            "These tasks include records of student information, student courses, and even their performance in Random Assessment Tests and Continuous Assessment Tests. ",
            "With this database; MS Access, we can query the database for specific student information. ",
            "For instance, if a teacher wants to know the details of the students who have failed their CATs, the database is queried to provide this information (\u201cA Beginners\u2019 Guide\u201d, N.D.). ",
            "With the database, we also generate reports to heads of departments containing specific information. ",
            "For instance, the head of the Computer Science department may want to know the number of students who are taking databases and their names. ",
            "This can be generated in the form of a report by Microsoft Access.\n",
            "In addition to Microsoft Access, the school uses JPAMS in preparing student grades, and their transcripts. ",
            "This is actually what the school uses the database mainly for. ",
            "The database is very instrumental in enabling the school to produce student transcripts in time. ",
            "It also comes in handy for teachers who may want to check how certain students, or even classes, have been performing. ",
            "The JAMS database is also used to capture student attendance so that it may be used in grading students, in case the school opts to implement that policy. ",
            "The database is holistic in the sense that, it captures all the information that may be of interest to teachers as they do their evaluation of how their students have performed throughout the semester. ",
            "For instance, a teacher may need to know issues related to the discipline of students in a certain semester or even in a certain year. ",
            "The JAMS software is very instrumental in such situations because it can generate discipline-related reports. ",
            "An example of these reports is the discipline frequency report, which gives discipline-related information with details like the time it occurred (Allen, 2009). ",
            "Another similar report is the court report, which gives performance-related information mapped against discipline-related information.\n",
            "As evidenced in the discussion above, my school mainly uses two databases. ",
            "These are Microsoft Access and the JAMS. ",
            "Microsoft Access is used to capture general everyday information like student details and performance in CATs, while JPAMS is used to capture students\u2019 performances and other relevant information. ",
            "The latter is any information that is deemed to affect student performance. ",

            "Personal Computer (PC) is defined by the American heritage dictionary as a small computer which is designed and intended for use by an individual at home or at work for light-computing tasks(\u201c\u201dPersonal computer\u201d). ",
            "The PC gained widespread adoption from the early 1980s with the introduction of versions of Apple computers notably the Apple II and later IBM PC by IBM which enabled many people to own computers in their homes. ",
            "Technological advancement and competition in the computer hardware industry has resulted in low-cost microprocessors and compacted computer parts. ",
            "Today there are a host of computer parts manufacturers that produce compatible components that work together when correctly assembled. ",
            "In this process essay it is shown that is it easy for anyone with little computer knowledge to assemble and own a computer of his/her own specifications.\n",
            "The first step in assembling a PC will involve gathering the components. ",
            "Some of the basic ones are: motherboard, Computer case, power supply unit, processor and its cooler, memory, hard disk drive, optical drives (DVD/CD/Blue ray drive), video graphics card, keyboard, mouse, monitor and operating system. ",
            "In addition, tools such as a set non-magnetic screw drivers, thermal paste ,manuals and a pair of pliers are also required. ",
            "The choice of many of these components is up to the owner and their prices vary depending on the manufacturer. ",
            "However, emphasis should be on their compatibility ,purpose and availability (\u201cHow to assemble a computer\u201d). ",
            "The motherboard forms one of the core components as everything is plugged onto it and its choice will depend on whether one is building an AMD or an Intel system. ",
            "It also determines the type of memory used, maximum speed and future upgradability (Hutcheson 3). ",
            "The processor will determine the speed of the system but the choice between the two major types-Intel and AMD- remains a matter of taste. ",
            "The case should be suitable as far as air circulation for CPU cooling is concerned. ",
            "For those that come with a power supply unit, it is important to ensure that it is compatible with the motherboard. ",
            "Hard Disk Drive is for storage but is important to go for the most modern ones with high speed (RPM). ",
            "Video card is required in case the motherboard lacks an integrated one or higher resolution is required. ",
            "Keyboard, mouse and monitor are required for configuring the system after the assembly. ",
            "The thermal paste serves to help in dissipating heat generated by the CPU and should be changed after a period of 6 months (Gupta n.pag). ",
            "Manual are critical for this process especially for beginners for reference purposes.\n",
            "After gathering all the components, the assembler should be aware of a few safety precautions before the actual assembly begins. ",
            "As static electricity can damage any electronic device, it is important for one to discharge static electricity from the body prior to handling any device. ",
            "This can be by wearing an anti-static wrist band or simply by touching the casing with both hands(Hutcheson 4). ",
            "In addition, excessive force should not be applied during installing of the components to avoid any damages (Hutcheson 4). ",
            "It is also important to work on a spacious table top in a well-lit room. ",
            "Before commencing the assembly process, the components should be unpacked from their wrappings and laid neatly on the working area.\n",
            "With all the parts ready and the necessary safety precautions in mind, the final activity is the actual assembly. ",
            "The first step involves opening the case and studying its layout particularly where the motherboard is laid. ",
            "The casing cover is can be removed by a sliding mechanism or unscrewing the screw on its back panel. ",
            "With the case open, the motherboard is then mounted on its inner side while ensuring that its integrated ports are well within the rectangular cut-out of the back panel. ",
            "This may involve securing it on the stand-offs on its perimeter or using screws. ",
            "The processor is then carefully inserted on the motherboard processor socket. ",
            "It is important to consult the motherboard manual for the correct alignment and locking mechanism. ",
            "With the processor well secured, the thermal paste is applied to cover the whole of its top. ",
            "This is followed by placing the heat sink on top the processor and locking it into place. ",
            "The locking may involve a lever like pin but it is important to consult the manual. ",
            "If the heat sink lacks an attached fan, the fan can be fixed with the help of its manual. ",
            "After inserting the processor and its coolers, the power supply unit (PSU) can be inserted (in case the case does not come bundled with one) in its position such that the power ports are visible from the back panel and held using screws. ",
            "The PSU is then connected to its corresponding 24 or 20-pin connector on the motherboard. ",
            "The square-like power cable for the processor from the PSU should also be connected on the appropriate port on the motherboard. ",
            "After installing the PSU, the memory modules can then be inserted on their slot on the motherboard by unlocking the end clips and gently pushing them down until the clips snap up. ",
            "Afterwards, the hard disk drive is inserted into its bay area and held using screw. ",
            "It is then connected to the power supply and its motherboard data cable. ",
            "The type of connection to the motherboard will depend on whether it is IDE or SATA-based in addition to the number installed. ",
            "The optical drives such as DVD/CD/Blue Ray drives are fixed by first removing the front panel plates and secured with screws inside their bay area. ",
            "They should also be connected to the power supply and onto the corresponding data cable from the motherboard. ",
            "I case of more than one non-SATA optical drives, the jumper setting should be set as required with the help of a manual. ",
            "The last step will involve connecting the wires of the power switch, the reset switch, the hard drive LED, internal speakers and other inputs such as front panel USB and audio panel to their appropriate motherboard ports. ",
            "It is very important to consult the motherboard manual on this as some of these have look-alike connectors and it may be easy to make a wrong connection. ",
            "However, this should not pose a serious problem as most motherboards bear appropriate abbreviations near the correct ports. ",
            "The graphic card if required or due to lack of an integrated one on the motherboard can be installed by fixing it firmly on a PCI slot after removing the cover plates at the back panel. ",
            "With everything in place, it is important to recheck every connection before closing the case cover and powering the computer after connecting the system unit to the monitor , keyboard ,mouse and to a power outlet. ",
            "A successful assembly will result in the system booting up although not to completion because of lack of the operating system. ",
            "After installing an operation system, a window system will require that installation of device drivers using the motherboard driver CD. ",
            "On the other hand, a system that does not boot up or results in smoke or a burning smell will require a recheck of the connections and /or verification of the individual components.\n",
            "Assembling a computer is a pretty simple affair nowadays. ",
            "It is possible to build a computer system that lives up to ones preference and taste. ",
            "The process involves sourcing the required components and connecting them together on a motherboard contained in a case. ",
            "With just the accompanying manuals any person with little computer knowledge can build a customized system that best serves his/her interests.\n",

            "I would like to bring to your attention the fact that the Electronic Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) is outdated and needs to be revised. ",
            "The Act contains good policies, but it has been twenty-four years since it was enacted, and since then, there have been major developments in communication technology. ",
            "The ECPA does not protect all forms of communications and consumer records. ",
            "Due to the provisions of this act, service providers are compelled to surrender consumer data from their servers to government agencies on demand. ",
            "The government agency demanding the consumer data only requires certification in writing that the information is for an investigation of foreign counterintelligence. ",
            "The certification does not need any judicial review to be effective, which exposes the provision to abuse by agencies.\n",
            "The types of crime on which surveillance can be used are therefore increased. ",
            "Although it may be argued that this provision is aimed at protecting the wider population, it leaves the privacy of the consumers in danger of being tampered with by anyone who can get a written statement certifying that the information is relevant. ",
            "This provision can also be abused by employers. ",
            "For example, once an employer has a suspicion that an employee is not acting in the company\u2019s interest, he/she can gain access to communications at the workplace, even though workplace communications are theoretically protected. ",
            "Although it may be argued that the employer has a right to protect the interest of the organization, this leaves the employee\u2019s privacy unprotected, since it is easy for an employer to get permission to monitor communications within the company.\n",
            "The Electronic Privacy Act also does not protect email in temporary storage. ",
            "Virtually all electronic mail is stored temporarily in transit at least once. ",
            "This means that there is no privacy enacted at all for electronic mail. ",
            "Although online email services make communication with loved ones easy, emails disclose a lot of information about a person\u2019s interests, habits, beliefs, and concerns. ",
            "Every citizen who uses email is therefore exposed and can have their privacy invaded. ",
            "Under the current electronic privacy law, if anybody leaves a message in their webmail account for more than a hundred and eighty days, the government can demand access to such a message without a search warrant. ",
            "The contents of such a message would have been accessed by third parties for whom the message was not meant, mainly the government officials charged with the duty of carrying out such access. ",
            "It may be argued that any private email that is useful would not remain unopened for such a long time, but this does not preserve any kind of privacy for people.\n",
            "It is clear that the Electronic Communication Act is outdated and should be revised to account for the recent developments in technology. ",
            "Upon revision, the ECPA will keep up with the current developments, such as protecting electronic mail that is in temporary storage. ",
            "The regulation should also ensure that employees\u2019 privacy is well guarded and employers should not infringe their privacy without the permission of the employee. ",
            "The permission to conduct surveillance should only be given to specific individuals of legitimate authority, and not just to anyone who can get a letter stating that they have permission; this way, it will reduce the number of crimes committed by people who can access others\u2019 information with the pretext that they have permission. ",
            "If all these precautions are enacted, there will be more consumer privacy and hence a heightened and healthier use of technology by American citizens.\n",

            "Viruses and worms are harmful computer programs that infect computers, often causing them to malfunction. ",
            "Although worms and viruses both infect computers and cause some sort of damage or data loss, there is a difference between the two. ",
            "A virus is a program that attaches itself to any computer file, usually an exe file, or program and spreads across with the help of data transfer from computer to computer. ",
            "(How Do Computer Viruses Spread?) A worm, on the other hand, does not need files to attach to and spread like viruses. ",
            "They make use of the already present file transfer systems to spread from one place to another (Vangie, n.d).\n",
            "With the advent of internet technology and a globally integrated network, viruses are spreading online more rapidly than any other means. ",
            "One of the most common ways online viruses spread is through spam email. ",
            "These are unwanted and often infected emails that clutter your inbox, offering fake product offers and attractions. ",
            "Viruses not only spread through spam mail but also through regular emails from known sources. ",
            "These viruses come with email attachments. ",
            "Another very common channel for viruses is through websites. ",
            "Many websites leave cookies for later identification but many plant viruses as well. ",
            "One of the most common forms of online virus spread is through downloading. ",
            "Downloading files off the internet from unreliable and unverified sources can harbor virus infections. ",
            "Many peer-to-peer networks such as LimeWire, Kazaa, and Bearshare have virus-infected files in search results that are disguised as actual search result files. ",
            "Another common way of virus spread is through removable media such as USB flash drives and on computer networks through file sharing and network drives as well. ",
            "Many popular viruses and worms spreading online, these days, are through automatically generated disguised links on Windows Live Messenger and Facebook. ",
            "These links appear to be sent by the users themselves and attract friends by offering them to explore provocative and interesting content. ",
            "An example of such a link would be, \u201cHey! ",

            "To prevent the spread of viruses and worms, there are certain precautionary measures that can be taken. ",
            "First, use a good virus scanner or anti-virus software to scan computers regularly. ",
            "Also, make sure that the software and scanners are up to date so that the latest virus definitions are supported. ",
            "Another measure that can be taken is to scan all files before transfer and scan all removable media before use and transfer. ",

            "I was continuously experiencing difficulty with hard disk detection by several software setups. ",
            "These also included the Windows XP setup. ",
            "Upon placing the installation into the CD tray, the setup would self-execute and when the setup would perform the automated system evaluation to determine whether or not the system specifications were up to mark with the software requirements, it would conclude the processing by displaying a message stating that no hard disk could be detected.\n",
            "I attributed the problem to corruption in the setup software in the beginning, but I soon noticed that the problem was recurring more frequently. ",
            "The problem became evident when upon trying to install software from a tried and tested CD, I was greeted by the same message once more. ",
            "It was at this point that I realized that the problem was not with the setup programs, but possibly lay in my system.\n",
            "To obtain help, I decided to use some of the many internet-based websites that offer free advice along with tips on tricks on how to achieve optimal performance. ",
            "These websites are more than often utilize user forums to generate their database of free advice which remains open to all the members of the website who wish to take advantage of the information or add to the information by joining the forum.\n",
            "Needless to say, these websites were not my first option. ",
            "My first inclination was to make use of the windows website to try and figure out if there was a troubleshooter that Microsoft had to offer that could help me figure out the source of the problem I had at hand.\n",
            "Trouble shooters are special programs that operate by asking the user a number of questions in a sequence (Synergenics, LLC, 2008). ",
            "These questions are designed to root out the problem that the user might be facing and the program usually functions by instructing the user on how to fix the problem once the problem has been identified by asking the user the sequential questions. ",
            "In certain cases, some trouble shooters are designed to carry out a an analysis of the system in order to ascertain the nature of the problem and to instruct the user on how exactly the problem has to be solved without taking the user through a lengthy series of questions.\n",
            "I decided to use no more than three websites in my search to determine the solution to my problem. ",
            "I was referred to the these three websites by my peers who told me they had experienced problems with their computers in the past and were of the opinion that these websites could provide me with the solution my problem. ",
            "The three websites that were brought into use and have been covered in this paper as well include:\n",

            "All of these three websites seem to be designed on the same user group forum philosophy that has been mentioned above. ",
            "Hence, it can be assumed that the advice that these websites gave was the information that the reader would eventually derive after going through the discussions on the query that the user was faced with. ",
            "In this particular case, I was greeted by a barrage of information on all three websites. ",
            "All three websites held user forums in which users had posted their advice and their comments regarding various problems and it took a bit of searching to find the user forum for the problem that I was faced with.\n",
            "In the case of PC Pitstop , the advice I got was that I should consider completely formatting my hard disk of the previous operating system before initiating the installation and if the problem still persisted, the user forum led me to the conclusion that I should attempt to make my BIOS recognize the Universal Serial Bus as a bootable device in order to get on with the installation (Invision Power Board, 2009). ",
            "So the advice given by PC Pitstop was based on a slight tinkering with the BIOS, and a complete reformatting of the current operating system from the hard drives.\n",
            "When going through Computing.Net , I was amazed to see that the problem I was facing had not only been experienced by other users the very same way such as I had seen in the PC Pitstop user forum, but was also shared by many other users who had experienced it at different points during the Windows XP setup as well. ",
            "Computing.Net also offered hard drive recovery tools that were placed within the forum of my interest (Computing.Net LLC, 2005). ",
            "Computing.Net was of the opinion that I required a few drivers to be installed before I began the actual windows installation. ",
            "This of course required that I make additional purchases of driver CDs.\n",
            "My third stop was Tom\u2019s Hardware , where I discovered that the issue of hard disk detection was even more widely encountered than I had presumed after witnessing the user forum at Computing.Net (Bestofmedia Network, 2005). ",
            "The advice I found on Tom\u2019s Hardware however was one that I chose to go through after I had successfully installed Windows XP since I found next to no advice on the problem of no detection of hard drives before the installation.\n",
            "I consider it necessary to mention at this point that I found no significant help on the Windows XP website at all. ",
            "The Windows XP was continuously subjecting me to a marketing campaign as I found myself drawn to the immense number of options that Windows XP had to offer and the equivalent number of tutorials that the website was overflowing with.\n",
            "In times like these, I discovered that the significance of this cottage industry is one that allows users to gain the knowledge that they need quickly and in a cost-efficient manner. ",
            "The websites also allowed users to take advantage of various shareware and freeware software by either directly downloading it or By doing so, these cottage industry websites allowed users to obtain cost effective technical support on Windows XP and other software while clearing the path for all the parties involved.\n",

            "Personal Computers\n",
            "Personal computers are multi-purpose, meaning they can be used for various things. ",
            "Their size, both physical and software, is usually average compared to institutional or work-specific computers. ",
            "One can argue that personal computers always target the end-user and not the computer guru. ",
            "Therefore, they are more user-friendly and easier to manoeuvre. ",
            "When selling personal computers, one should understand the needs of the end-user to pair him or her with a suitable device. ",
            "If the end-user is a gamer, for example, he or she will be attracted to detailed specifications on the suggested computer\u2019s ability to handle such heavy graphics, and so forth. ",
            "The following items are some of the key selling points of any type of personal computer.\n",
            "RAM and ROM\n",
            "Both the Read-Only Memory (ROM) and the Random Access Memory (RAM) are key elements of a personal computer. ",
            "The specification of each will depend on the major activities the user will conduct on the computer. ",
            "As a salesperson, it is important to fully understand the difference between the two to understand the client\u2019s needs. ",
            "Taylor explains that the ROM is a non-volatile storage chip (p. ",
            "35). ",
            "This means that contents and data stored in the ROM are not affected by the presence of power or lack thereof. ",
            "On the other hand, RAM is volatile (Taylor, p. ",
            "35). ",
            "A client looking for a personal computer mainly for gaming purposes will need one with a larger ROM as compared to the RAM. ",
            "This is since the ROM cannot be manipulated easily, and secondly, the ROM can handle several applications in one device (like the game console). ",
            "Additionally, data is stored permanently in ROM while it is only temporarily stored in the RAM chip.\n",
            "Architecture and Platforms\n",
            "Featherstone explains that a computer platform is an environment in which software is run (p. ",
            "45). ",
            "Using this definition, one can argue that there are many different computer platforms. ",
            "It is prudent to note that these digital platforms can take the form of both hardware and operating system. ",
            "Again, as a salesperson, the needs of the client should guide which type of platform you advertise. ",
            "If the client is interested in the hardware aspect, then some examples that will excite him or her include the video game console for gamers or the ARM architecture that is most suited for people that link their computers to their mobile phones (Tolga, p. ",
            "158). ",
            "Concerning the operating systems, the client will be interested in knowing whether the device uses Linux, Windows NT, FreeBSD, or Solaris, among other similar software. ",
            "Software frameworks such as JAVA and Mozilla Prism are also important to mention.\n",
            "Advantages and Disadvantages of Two Platforms\n",
            "Both the platforms mentioned (either hardware or operating system) have advantages and disadvantages. ",
            "It is common to find a client comparing two different platforms of the same architecture. ",
            "For instance, one can compare Linux to Windows NT. ",
            "One advantage of Linux is that it is significantly safe from malware attacks. ",
            "Additionally, the operating system is very affordable and is one of the most stable operating systems in the market (Whitt 201). ",
            "Despite this, the software has several disadvantages. ",
            "For example, a significant number of other software cannot run on Linux. ",
            "On the other hand, software in the market can run in Windows NT. ",
            "Another advantage of Windows NT is that it is very user-friendly, especially compared to Linux (Panek, p. ",
            "4). ",
            "Also, because there are many Windows users, there are hardware developed that run on Windows easily compared to any other operating system. ",
            "Just like Linux, Windows NT has its disadvantages. ",
            "One major disadvantage is that it is easily attacked by malware. ",
            "Secondly, the software is also expensive compared to Linux.\n",
            "Five factors to consider when purchasing a personal computer\n",
            "Apart from ROM and RAM, there are other things that a client will need to consider when purchasing a personal computer. ",
            "The first is the price of the computer, which will be informed by the amount of money the client is willing to spend. ",
            "Secondly, the client should also consider the processor, which is essential in both input and output. ",
            "Third, the client has to think about the graphics. ",
            "The right graphics will be determined by the major uses of the computer as they affect things such as resolution and so forth. ",
            "The inbuilt software is also important to note. ",
            "Indeed, clients can buy and change software at any point of their computer use. ",
            "However, to save on costs, the client should get a computer that already has stable and reliable inbuilt software. ",
            "This also goes hand-in-hand with the availability and reliability of anti-virus software that can be installed. ",
            "There are operating systems that do not require additional anti-virus software. ",
            "However, the software will require such additional security and this would mean additional costs for the client. ",
            "To best serve the client, the salesperson needs to understand the specifications of personal computers and also the needs of the buyer.\n",

            "Is the Human Mind Simply a Biological Computer \u2013 Except Slower?\n",
            "When contemplating the man-like intelligence of machines, the computer immediately comes to mind but how does the \u2018mind\u2019 of such a machine compare to the mind of man? ",
            "A human brain assimilates and processes much the same as a computer. ",
            "However, because the mind of man possesses consciousness, it perceives beauty, generates moral judgments and formulates rationalizations which the machine cannot execute. ",
            "When the computer was in its early development stages, it was thought of as an electronic, thinking device, the mechanical equivalent of the human brain. ",
            "This misconception is a gross oversimplification of the seemingly limitless boundaries of the human mind. ",
            "The potential of machines were thought to be able to eventually encompass \u201can inductive and creative mind, capable of taking initiative, to which human beings could confide all their problems and obtain instant solutions in return.\u201d (Ifrah, p. ",
            "1679 1997)\n",
            "Simply stated, computers are machines which effectively carry out algorithmic functions. ",
            "The machine discerns formalized input through a sequence of fixed stages through a predetermined, straightforward set of rules of a standardized and exacting description. ",
            "This allows computers to perform procedures in a precise number of steps. ",
            "Mechanical computers, unlike the functions of the computer-like brain does not have the capability to determine right from wrong nor can it make judgments, has no feelings and cannot think on its own. ",
            "It cannot be denied that some types of intelligence can be attributed to computers but this capacity is very limited when balanced against the boundless intricacies in a human\u2019s brain. ",
            "However, the computer is superior when considering its capability to process information at a higher speed. ",
            "This has provided humans a useful tool for a myriad of endeavors. ",
            "Nevertheless, computers cannot reason, imagine, invent, create, express thoughts, manage ideas, make judgments or possess the ability to adapt to differing situations and therefore cannot solve problems that are new to it. ",
            "Unlike the human brain computers aren\u2019t conscious of its own being therefore has no concept of the world around it and cannot execute voluntary activities. ",
            "(Kak, 2005)\n",
            "Because machines only able to follow directives, they do not possess the capability to be self-aware. ",
            "Conversely, if it is accepted that computers do not and will never become aware of its own being, then it is reasonable to ask what enables the human\u2019s biological machine to attain consciousness while the silicon-based computerized \u2018brain\u2019 cannot. ",
            "Possibly, the answer to this question is the fact that the structure of the human brain is self-organizing. ",
            "It responds to the individual characteristics and the independent nature of interactions between itself and the particular environment. ",
            "Computers do not have the ability to accomplish this.\n",
            "Consciousness allows for the acknowledgement of beauty which is known only to those that possess biological intelligence. ",
            "Aesthetics value has very little in common with the processing of information. ",
            "Beauty is a known but knowing this information is not a process of mathematical computations. ",
            "Both the brain and the computer can add numbers but the computer is not impressed with this knowledge nor does it feel pride in accomplishing new tasks such as the biological mind might. ",
            "The reasoning for why the brain knows to perform a function then knowingly yearns for more knowledge or finds the procedure a fulfilling experience remains unclear. ",
            "The computer, by contrast only knows to perform the function when prompted. ",
            "It has no contemplations regarding the knowing of the experience. ",
            "The human mind can contemplate its own functions and existence. ",
            "It may also think that the various functions of it or a computer is wondrous, beautiful event. ",
            "This, along with the fact that the machine produces predictable results is the factor that separates the two processing entities. ",
            "However, this viewpoint is a superficial observation of the human mind because there remains much more regarding the mysteries of the brain as opposed to the mechanical function of the computer. ",
            "The brain has the ability to reject new knowledge where the computer does not. ",
            "This allows for an aura of individuality that machines do not enjoy. ",
            "(Clear 2003)\n",
            "The human mind has the ability to know what is morally right or wrong almost instantly without the need for assimilating much information. ",
            "It can make decisions based on the unknown knowledge and can rationalize, justify and reason which is traits only known to that which is conscious. ",
            "Knowledge has no life. ",
            "It is based only on cold facts whereas knowing is uniquely biological in nature. ",
            "There is much puzzlement regarding knowledge and knowing.\n",
            "In generally terms, it is assumed that the activities that differentiate human thought from that of a machines conceptualization are best characterized by the understanding of language although it cannot be denied that those who are deaf or mute do in fact think though they do not speak at the same level as others. ",
            "In addition, studies have shown that most types of animal life have the capability to learn and solve problems. ",
            "The use of language is as a compartment of a larger inventory of behaviors. ",
            "Computers do not possess the ability of humans or even of animals to formulate or initiate any type of language on its own. ",
            "Computer \u2018language\u2019 is pre-programmed. ",
            "The use of uninitiated language, no matter how primitive, is within the realm of biological beings alone. ",
            "(Clear 2003)\n",
            "The difference between the human brain and a machine of any type is that humans create machines to be used as a tool. ",
            "Human intellect is extremely intricate and consciousness too mysterious to be duplicated. ",
            "On the day that a computer can lie or cheat, when it prays to an unknown entity and feels shame or sorrow then, possibly, it can be compared to the human mind. ",
            "Until then, the only similarity is that both process information but to vastly different extents and by different methods.\n",

            "The Man\n",
            "William H. ",
            "Gates III, erstwhile Chairman/\u201cChief Software Architect\u201d of Microsoft Corporation, and now co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, famously ranked as the wealthiest man in America for fifteen years running. ",
            "Though he had an attorney for a father, it is likely that his entrepreneurial spirit came from a \u201cmulti-tasking\u201d mother, Mary Gates, who juggled teaching, being regent at the University of Washington in Seattle, and chairing United Way International.\n",
            "The story of how Bill Gates helped lay the foundation for the desktop personal computer revolution \u2013 first by cooperating with Steve Ballmer to \u201cport\u201d the mainframe language BASIC for microcomputers right in their Harvard dorm rooms and, after dropping out of Harvard, by writing the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) with lifelong friend Paul Allen \u2013 parallels the entrepreneurial legend of Steve Jobs at Apple Computer in the mid-1970s.\n",
            "The evident personal philosophy of Bill Gates comprised being hard-driving, looking out for long-term results, being a ruthless competitor, defending market gains, and maximizing profits. ",
            "This last typifies even the couple\u2019s philanthropic foundation, which has been accused of investing for returns more than donating to alleviate poverty in developing countries. ",
            "In Mintzberg\u2019s typology, therefore, Gates has shown himself more interested in being, first, the entrepreneur, and subsequently figurehead/ spokesperson, and world-renowned leader.\n",
            "The Company\n",
            "Microsoft was registered in 1975 as a privately-held corporation and went public with an initial public offering in 1986. ",
            "From then on, or for the next 23 years, the company has held the top position in the global software industry by a combination of ruthless and unethical business practices.\n",
            "Right from the start, Microsoft concentrated on writing the software that would interface between machine language (that only programmers had the patience to learn) and true end-user software such as word processors, spreadsheets, accounting programs, or Internet browsers. ",
            "These interface software layers are called compilers and one of the first the company developed was the TASC, The \u201cAppleSoft Compiler\u201d, to run BASIC on the unique machine language that was Apple\u2019s, The aforementioned BASIC was written for the Altair 8800, one of many start-up brands competing for a fair share of the embryonic desktop computer market at that time.\n",
            "The real breakthrough came when Microsoft repackaged a clone of the CP/M operating system and licensed it to IBM, then about to launch the category-creating modular IBM PC, as \u201cIBM DOS\u201d. ",
            "When other hardware makers managed to clone the IBM BIOS (the \u201cBasic Input/Output System\u201d), Microsoft sold the same thing to all manufacturers as MS (Microsoft) DOS. ",
            "Since the product by then cost nothing except the nominal expense of disk-to-disk copying, the foundation was laid for the enormous cash flow that allowed now Seattle-based Microsoft to develop dozens of end-user software packages far into the future.\n",
            "Since Bill Gates was never shy about proclaiming his dream of seeing \u201ca computer in every home,\u201d the Microsoft target markets comprise both consumer and industrial users. ",
            "To attain this goal, the company struck deals with PC makers/ assemblers to have MS-DOS pre-installed on every PC sold. ",
            "Next, the company developed the Windows operating system in a blatant attempt to imitate the Apple graphic user interface, which was extremely intuitive and easy to use. ",
            "Not till version 3.1, however, did Microsoft have something the market could grudgingly accept. ",
            "Then Microsoft struck at all the software companies that tailored their end-user software to work on MS-DOS and Windows. ",
            "Again by striking pre-installed deals and bundling everything possible into Microsoft Office, the company killed off, in succession, Netscape, Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, dBase III, Eudora, Freelance Graphics, and even Norton Utilities. ",
            "By the time regulatory authorities in the U.S. ",
            "and the EU could file suit for monopolistic practices, the dust had settled and bloated Microsoft software owned the market.\n"

            "The Effectiveness of the Computer Essay\n",
            "The modern computer is the product of close to a century of sequential inventions. ",
            "It is also the result of a corroboration that has spanned national and continental borders. ",
            "And all through, this evolution has been driven by one need: to automate tasks. ",
            "Mankind realized that rearranging inanimate matter could result in certain mechanical advantages. ",
            "This is the essence of machines. ",
            "Knowledge accumulated, and we came up with machines that could totally replace humans in some tasks. ",
            "This discovery steadied up the evolution, since human limitations, at least on the physical level, were reduced. ",
            "And now, we are using these machines to catalogue all the knowledge we have accumulated over the years. ",
            "We are in the information age, and the computer has become a central determinant of our performance.\n",
            "The effectiveness of the computer pivots on one major characteristic: speed. ",
            "Every task that a computer does is first broken down into simple, logical steps. ",
            "These steps are then converted into number values that so that the computer can understand. ",
            "The manipulation of these numbers can be seen as a kind of arithmetic. ",
            "A modern computer does thousands, even millions, of calculations, every second, in order to maintain a satisfactory level of output for the user. ",
            "This is because it has to break down natural language into machine language. ",
            "Text and numbers are easy for a computer to handle. ",
            "Media like music and images require more sophisticated manipulation. ",
            "To illustrate this fact, consider that in order for a computer to play an audio file lasting four minutes, it has to go through the same rigors needed to read a bible, from cover to cover, twice!\n",
            "So fast are modern computers that they can now multitask. ",
            "Multitasking is simply performing several tasks at the same time. ",
            "An average computer can be accessing the internet, displaying a video, and processing some calculations at the same time. ",
            "This dimension in computers has expanded the horizons, as far as their applicability is concerned. ",
            "Computers, if well used, can drastically cut down on the amount of time required to accomplish menial tasks. ",
            "Mainframes and mini-frame computers have taken this a step further, with one central computer being available for use by several people at the same time.\n",
            "While operating at incredible speeds, computers have the added advantage of being very accurate. ",
            "Actually, if fed correct data, a computer can always be counted on to produce the correct responses, unless there is a problem with its programming. ",
            "This advantage can be directed correlated to the fact that now people can concentrate more on the big picture, instead of wasting time rechecking their information and statistics for accuracy. ",
            "Progress in all sorts of human endeavors is thus much faster.\n",
            "Computers have forever changed the field of communication. ",
            "A mere couple of decades ago, trans-continental communication used to take days, sometimes even weeks, depending on the mode of communication. ",
            "Nowadays, communication to any part of the world can be instantaneous, and requires only the click of a button. ",
            "This is the significance of the internet. ",
            "Through the internet, computers communicate with each other at dizzying speeds, spewing forth amazing loads of data, and saving billions of dollars in communication charges. ",
            "This has even changed the way business is done today. ",
            "With a minimum of resources, any business can nowadays operate on the international scale. ",
            "Some businesses are already doing this, by outsourcing some of their interests across national borders. ",
            "Billion-dollar decisions are now made in split-seconds, and effected with the click of a button. ",
            "Little wonder, then, that some businesses are shooting up from obscurity into empires overnight.\n",
            "The primary reason for inventing computers in the first place has been taken to a whole new level. ",
            "Nowadays, computers have automated so many tasks previously done by humans that some jobs are nowadays the reserves of computers. ",
            "Any repetitive task can be relegated to a computer. ",
            "This is because modern computers can be instructed to perform new tasks, and will execute their instructions precisely, as long as they are equipped with the necessary accessories. ",
            "With the evolution in computers, robots have been made to handle tasks that are either repetitive or dangerous for humans. ",
            "This way, computers have increased the overall safety level of humans.\n",
            "The first computers were hard to use. ",
            "They needed specialized knowledge, since information had to be fed to the computer in special formats. ",
            "However, with time, more convenient methods of communicating with computers have evolved. ",
            "These methods approach natural language with each day. ",
            "For example, computers can now recognize speech, and execute commands that have been fed to them verbally. ",
            "Scientists are working towards optical recognition in computers, so that they can recognize faces, expressions and gestures. ",
            "With such breakthroughs in technology, computers will soon be just as user friendly as the next person. ",
            "A future when computers will respond to human emotions is foreseeable. ",
            "At that stage, computers will be at their highest effectiveness, tackling problems with their amplified efficiency, while drawing little attention to themselves.\n",
            "Of course, computers are not without some drawbacks. ",
            "One of the most significant drawbacks with them is that they have now divided societies into two major groups: the computer literate, and the computer illiterate. ",
            "One group has a distinct advantage in this information age. ",
            "The other has to make do with traditional methods of tackling problems, or learn computers. ",
            "Anybody who can not utilize the advantages of the computer is soon left behind by the rest of the society.\n",
            "Another disadvantage is that computers have replaced many people in the work place. ",
            "It can be argued that these replacements are part of human advancements, but the rates at which computers are replacing people have left many people reeling from the unexpected. ",
            "It now requires a higher level of innovativeness to stay relevant in the changing landscape of technology. ",
            "Very soon, most job descriptions will be the preserve of computers, and humans will just have to invent other job positions.\n",
            "The ease at which information can be transmitted through computers has some drawbacks too. ",
            "For example, some unscrupulous individuals have used internet channels to defraud others. ",
            "The internet offers anonymity, and thus immunity from legal recourses. ",
            "Billions of dollars are lost every year from these online fraudsters, and some of them simply disappear. ",
            "Efforts are being done to tighten online security but somehow, fraudsters seem capable of keeping up with technological advances. ",
            "Information flow through the internet can also compromise the security of institutions. ",
            "For example, through satellite mapping, it is now possible to gather sensitive information on such premises as army barracks. ",
            "Some terrorists have been known to use this while planning their attacks.\n",
            "And finally, while computers are all good at storing information and processing it, the rapid increase and transfer of information is producing an information-overload scenario. ",
            "This is where people are being confronted with so much information that they end up uncertain of what to make of it. ",
            "Information overload is a real threat in these modern days, and can result in all sorts of eventualities, including mental breakdowns in people.\n",

            "Since that time humanity started to speak of different signs of \u201ccomputer addiction\u201d \u2013 the term stands to emphasize the seriousness of the problem and implies the possibility of drastic consequences that computer mania might have. ",
            "Contrary to existing views the problem of computer addiction exists, humanity needs to be extremely cautious of its bad effects and it has to work out appropriate treatment to help computer-dependent people to solve their problems. ",
            "In the current paper, we will explore the problem with the emphasis made on the bad effects of computer addiction and possible solutions that might be offered to reduce them to a minimum or to get rid of computer addiction at all.\n",
            "The reality of modern life is such that personal computers and Internet access have been proliferating across the world. ",
            "Everyday activities at home, work, and school are increasingly dependent upon computers. ",
            "Through the Internet, the computer becomes a useful tool for communication. ",
            "The importance of computers and the Internet, in particular, can hardly be overestimated but their properties that promote addictive behaviors should not be neglected. ",
            "Cyberspace that computers and the Internet create may result in cyber disorders such as virtual relationships that evolve into online marital infidelity or online sexually compulsive behaviors. ",
            "An increasing mental health concern, cyber disorders have been identified to diagnose serious issues related to Internet use (Young & Rogers 25). ",
            "The side effects that computer overuse has to speak for the fact that computer addiction exists.\n",
            "Moreover, the existence of computer addiction in modern society is proven by Margaret Shotton\u2019s research. ",
            "The author conducts an investigation that proves the existence of computer dependency through obtaining the facts from a number of sources, namely, existing literature on the problem, the authors of the literature, and other psychologists, computer studies teachers, and professional care agencies. ",
            "Personal contact was made with people who worked with computers and average computer users. ",
            "They all showed belief in the occurrence of the syndrome of computer dependency. ",
            "Though the respondents did not consider the syndrome to be a widespread problem believing that it affected only a few individuals among the vast number of computer users but the research still confirmed the existence of the syndrome of computer dependency (Shotton 20).\n",
            "The research has shown that interviewees had both psychological (inability to stop the activity; neglect of family and friends; problems with them, etc) and physical (carpal tunnel syndrome; dry eyes; migraine headaches; backaches) symptoms of computer addiction. ",
            "Though most of the dependents did not want to admit their addiction some did admit that they experienced negative effects from their activities. ",
            "Some interviewees spoke of the negative effects that their computer addiction had on their employment. ",
            "One person admitted that in the past he had spent time playing with the computer while he was at work. ",
            "But the addiction disappeared when he bought his own home microcomputer upon which he had unrestricted access to the program as he wished. ",
            "Another interviewee admitted that it was difficult for him to concentrate at work, instead of handling the problems that appeared he found himself puzzling over computer problems that he could explore only while at home. ",
            "This turned out to be especially problematic when he was cycling home from work as not once he had nearly ridden into parked vehicles. ",
            "Computer addiction was observed with people of different occupations, therefore, there is no strict rule as to who can fall victim to computer addiction and who cannot.\n",
            "What one can state firmly is that computer addiction has negative effects on the process of learning. ",
            "Students of different ages admitted that their academic performance suffered because of their devotion to computing. ",
            "\u201cMy schoolwork suffers\u201d, \u201cIt detracts from my schoolwork\u201d, were the commonest answers of those who realized they were achieving lower standards academically (212) Therefore, it is also teachers\u2019 concern to help the students get rid of computer addiction.\n",
            "Constant involvement with computer activities influences the social lives of dependents. ",
            "Computers take much of dependents\u2019 free time and, as a result, less time is spent communicating with others. ",
            "Different misunderstanding appears on the basis of the absence of common interest to computing. ",
            "Many respondents from Shotton\u2019s research admitted that they found computing an escape from social interaction: they found it stressful in the past and computers enabled them to get rid of the undesired communication. ",
            "Domestic disharmony, problems in sexual relationships \u2013 these were the commonest Negative effects of computer addiction on a family scale (213). ",
            "To reduce them some help from dependent friends, family members are needed. ",
            "Their task is to help the addict realize that no machine can substitute real communication.\n",
            "Other side effects are those on the personalities of the dependents. ",
            "People addicted to computers tend to be more intolerant and impatient with others. ",
            "The computer becomes a sort of refuge from real life for them and they become more reserved and restrained. ",
            "Sometimes a computer-dependent person loses interest in the world around him and does not care about one\u2019s happiness. ",
            "This occurs because the computer is seen by this person as the only \u201ccreature\u201d in the world that can understand him or her.\n",
            "The negative physical effects of computer addiction include restlessness, sleeplessness, tension, headache, and backache. ",
            "If computer dependents suffer from some disease the disease worsens while constantly working on the computer.\n",
            "Internet addiction as a form of computer addiction deserves special consideration. ",
            "An Internet-addicted person loses the ability to control one\u2019s use of the Internet. ",
            "This lack of control causes marked distress and/or functional impairment (Shapira et al. ",
            "270). ",
            "The addiction may go along with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or alcohol and drug addiction. ",
            "The most obvious symptoms of Internet addiction include social isolation, family discord, divorce, academic failure, job loss, and debt (Young et al. ",
            "475). ",
            "Other symptoms are: neglecting responsibilities, feelings of depression, tension, anger when the Internet is not accessible, etc. ",
            "There are five Internet-related issues that Internet addiction is composed of cyber sexual addiction, cyber relationship addiction, net compulsions, information overload, and addiction to interactive computer games (476). ",
            "No matter what type of addiction a dependent suffers from the side effects of it are always serious. ",
            "Actually, they are the same as the ones of computer addiction in general. ",
            "Internet addiction influences negatively relationships within families and may even bring significant financial problems. ",
            "As it was stated above the dependent\u2019s realization of the problem is needed as well as help from friends, teachers, and members of the family. ",

            "It is based on Beck\u2019s (1976) theory that thoughts determine feelings. ",
            "The theory encourages the dependent to recognize thoughts and feelings causing him/her to inappropriately use the computer to meet personal needs (Orzack, 1999 15). ",
            "This is achieved through the following stages: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, maintenance, and termination. ",
            "In the first stage, the dependent does not recognize the problem that he or she has and, therefore, does not want to change anything. ",
            "Thus, the therapist\u2019s task at this stage is to help the patient understand that the problem exists and help him/her realize the necessity of solving it. ",
            "In the second stage, the individual recognizes the need for change but still does not have a substantial desire to change something. ",
            "In the preparation stage, the individual is ready to establish a plan to address the problem. ",
            "The dependent person realizes that he or she needs to establish control over computer use by setting time limits. ",
            "The person seeks other activities that can be done when the urge to use the computer exists. ",
            "The maintenance stage begins when the dependent learn to control one\u2019s computer use. ",
            "The goal of this phase is to prevent relapse. ",
            "The final stage, termination, occurs when the individual has no more desire to overuse the computer. ",

            "The research article \u201cESL Students\u2019 Computer-Mediated Communication Practices\u201d evaluates and analyses language learning practices based on computer-mediated communication (CMC). ",
            "The author concentrates on the problem of joint activities and on \u201chow a group of ESL students jointly constructed the context of their CMC activities through interactional patterns and norms\u201d This topic is extremely interesting to theorists and practitioners because it helps to understand students\u2019 communication and participation in e-learning activities and the best possible ways to design effective language practices. ",
            "Computer-mediated communication use in language learning is catching on for training and education worldwide at all levels. ",
            "Computer-mediated communication is not just a trendy word. ",
            "It is a new approach built on what we have learned from developing and instructing with thirty years of computer-based methods and on what we know about how to help people learn. ",
            "The concept of Computer-mediated communication is changing the way educators instruct and learn. ",
            "At the same time, Computer-mediated communication is evolving, and it is likely that what we call e-learning today will be different in a few years. ",
            "Previous studies discuss the context and environment of language learning and teaching, technologies, pedagogy, curriculum, and social discourses on CMC. ",
            "The author hopes to add facts and data about the interactional patterns of ESL students, interactional norms the ESL students establishing, and answer the question \u201chow do the ESL students utilize CMC activities for their linguistic, social, and academic goals?\u201d (Shin 65). ",
            "All the questions are specific and clear based on careful literature analysis and problems identified by previous studies. ",
            "While inputs are important to the success of learning, they are only part of the story. ",
            "Instructional designers should concentrate on outputs such as measured increases in job and business performance, either in the quality of goods and services produced or in the job satisfaction of employees producing those goods and services. ",
            "Solid instruction is concentrated on what people need to learn to enhance their performance as students or workers. ",
            "A better understanding of what constitutes successful learning and how to achieve it helps managers with the selection of courseware from vendors and helps instructional designers in the creation of materials.\n",
            "The research study follows an ecological Perspectives of Second Language Learning. ",
            "Special attention is given to human learning processes and its environment perceived as \u201can integrated entity involving cognitive, social, and environmental elements\u201d (Shin 66). ",
            "The author uses interpretive parading of the research. ",
            "This means that the article is based on personal experience, observational and interaction approaches. ",
            "Inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning are both subsumed under scientific inquiry, yet they characterize a distinction between purely qualitative and purely quantitative methods. ",
            "Student teachers\u2019 quantitative ratings of their experiences on questionnaires followed interpretive analyses of their narrative responses. ",
            "The research design is based on the ethnographic method. ",
            "\u201cThis ethnographic case study was conducted in an intermediate adult ESL class with 16 students at a university in the northeastern United States\u201d (Shin 66). ",
            "Ethnography helps the author to study the commonsense features of everyday situations the common, ordinary happenings in a particular set of interests. ",
            "In these studies, social interaction as an ongoing process is scrutinized and recorded in descriptive detail. ",
            "The participants of the research are international graduate students, visiting scholars, and their spouses. ",
            "All of the participants were from Northern Asia (1 student from Peru). ",
            "All of them have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. ",
            "They were selected based on the questionnaire method and personal interviews. ",
            "Personal information was the main criterion for selection. ",
            "The main principles were: (1) Asian origin, (2) BA degree obtained in a home country, (3) engineering or natural sciences field of study, (4) \u201cgraduate student and visiting scholar participants were men, and all the spousal participants were women\u201d (Shin 66), (5) good relations with a teacher (Johnson 77).\n",
            "The main data collection methods were observations and surveys, formal and informal interviews with participants, e-mail exchanges between the teacher and the ESL participants. ",
            "also, the data was collected from offline FtF class meetings, In all situations, the researcher acted as a participant-observer. ",
            "The researcher \u201cidentified recursive patterns through triangulation of field notes, transcripts of recorded FtF class meetings, interview data, and electronically saved chat data\u201d (Shin 67). ",
            "Interviewing informants involved using phrasing and vocabulary more closely in tune with the subjects\u2019 own and less abstractly than in instruments used in quantitative studies. ",
            "This, therefore, increased the likelihood of the instrument being able to tap the information for which it was developed. ",
            "Participant observation was conducted in natural settings that were the reality of the life experiences of subjects more so than are contrived settings of quantitative studies. ",
            "The analysis in ethnography used a process of \u201cresearcher self-monitoring,\u201d a \u201cdisciplined subjectivity\u201d that brings the study under continual questioning. ",
            "The data were analyzed systematically and appropriately answered the research questions. ",
            "The analysis allowed the researcher to reconstruct Interactional Patterns among students.\n",
            "The findings show that the teacher should pay special attention to computer-mediated learning environments and communication practices among students because they have a major impact on language learning. ",
            "\u201cThe participants\u2019 learning experiences in online chatting demonstrate that language learning and language socialization are interwoven into the fabric of CMC practices\u201d (Shin 70). ",
            "An informal computer-mediated communication resource is the online discussion group. ",
            "Participants can learn a great deal by formulating and posting queries and by just lurking and observing questions and answers posted by other participants. ",
            "Some discussion groups archive the replies to questions, and many have a section where key questions and answers are posted. ",
            "In self-paced e-learning, the learners themselves determine the speed\u2014and sometimes the sequence\u2014of their progress through a professionally developed training course (Morrison 31). ",
            "Because self-paced courses and materials are designed and developed by training professionals, they are a formal rather than informal method of learning. ",
            "The researcher identifies that offline lives influence language learning practices and the success of language acquisition. ",
            "\u201cEcologically exploring the ways illustrates their identities/subjectivities regarding co-constructed norms, rules, and goals, as well as specific interests and concerns embedded in their language socialization processes through CMC\u201d (Shin 70). ",
            "Generally, students appreciate the convenience, choice, and flexibility that CMC activities offer. ",
            "Instructional designers value the standardized framework and flexibility of CMC activities. ",
            "Instructors think CMC activities are convenient; they applaud the ease of record-keeping and the reduced travel that are part of the e-learning revolution. ",
            "The author finds that learners must first acquire the lower-level skills (knowledge, comprehension, and application, for example) before they can perform the higher-level skills (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation). ",
            "The different levels are also taught differently. ",
            "The higher-level skills require carefully designed application exercises to ensure that the learning has occurred and has \u201cstuck.\u201d For example, if the focus is on learning to synthesize the concepts of e-learning as presented in this book, an effective learning program would ensure that participants acquired the basic knowledge of the four types of e-learning, were able to explain them either orally or in writing, could explain the relationships between e-learning and conventional learning, and would be able to synthesize or use this knowledge in a specific situation to recommend what types of e-learning to use. ",
            "The first step to understanding learning, in general, is an understanding of learning styles. ",
            "People have ways they prefer to learn, which are often called preferred learning styles. ",
            "The most effective teaching methods, whether in the classroom or through a computer, are those that accommodate the preferred learning styles of the people being taught.\n",
            "The author concludes that CMC activities are seen as language socialization and help students to understand complex lives and \u201ca complexity that comes from multiple social roles\u201d (Shin 70). ",
            "There are no conclusions made on the researcher\u2019s guesses thus he states that it is important to examine \u201chow language learners carry their interests and life stories over to online language learning spaces\u201d (Shin 70). ",
            "All recommendations follow logically from the findings and data analysis. ",
            "There are many schools of thought about learning styles, but no universally accepted approach to defining them or adjusting instructional designs and methods to account for them.\n",
            "The research study proposes an interesting analysis of computer-mediated learning and language acquisition practices. ",
            "I would like to ask the researcher about problems he was faced during the research and the attitude of students towards this research.\n",
            "The research is well-constructed and based on appropriate methodology. ",
            "Thus, the researcher ignores external validity. ",
            "First, the purpose is to describe in detail aspects of a single subject, group, or unit. ",
            "And, even if multiple sites are used, the researcher is obligated to enter each site as if he or she had no other information and as if this site were unique. ",
            "Therefore, there are no bases for comparison or generalizability. ",
            "Third, the problem studied, the nature of the goals and the application of the findings differ substantially from traditional quantitative methods, and so definitions of external validity must vary. ",
            "Concerning the problem studied, the credibility of quantitative designs should be based on examining effects in controlled situations, looking at variables uniquely, one at a time. ",
            "Regarding the goals of studies, the goal of ethnographic research should be to develop theory not to test it, which requires that a priori relationships be avoided. ",
            "While quantitative researchers aim to generalize from the sample to the population, and external validity must be (Garrison and Anderson 23).\n",
            "The author did not consider the different learning styles. ",
            "First, it is critical to identify the predominant learning styles of the people who will be taking the e-learning program. ",
            "Research indicates, for example, that recent graduates from Asian countries prefer concrete action. ",
            "The same research indicates that instructors tend to prefer an abstract approach to learning. ",
            "In other words, young people prefer to learn by doing, while instructors prefer to learn by developing concepts. ",
            "Potential trouble here! ",
            "At least there could be trouble if instructors teach youth in the way that they personally prefer to learn. ",
            "The researcher materials must also take care to ensure that their own preferred learning styles do not govern the instructional design. ",
            "The researcher must consider the learning styles of the people who will be taking the program\u2014and they could be convergers, divergers, assimilators, or accommodators, or likely a mix of all four (Morrison 102).\n",
            "Much has been written about the virtue of interactive learning\u2014using questions, exercises, and other activities to engage learners as active participants in the learning process. ",
            "The research under analysis does not take into account the nature and types of tasks and different perceptions of students. ",
            "Interactive learning should keep students energized and help participants absorb information and remember it. ",
            "It would be important to analyze how interactive learning help students focus. ",
            "To understand how this works, consider that the human brain functions five or six times faster than instructors speak or e-learning audio files play. ",
            "If a classroom instructor, an online instructor, or an e-learning module limits the messages to facts, participants whose minds are working five times as fast as the information is being delivered will start to draw their own conclusions\u2014and perhaps daydream about subjects not related to the material being taught. ",
            "Clearly, interaction is a valuable component of a successful learning experience. ",
            "But how to create interaction in e-learning? ",
            "As an instructor, instructional designer, or administrator, you must think clearly about interactivity. ",
            "also, the researcher does not take into account the fact that carefully designed learning activities challenge learners, even in a self-directed format. ",
            "Games are one engaging activity from the classroom that can be applied to e-learning, and there are several others. ",
            "Learning works best, you have been taught, when the designer follows a structured process of needs analysis, development of performance objectives, rigorous development of content, a structured delivery, and evaluation.\n",

            "The case study deals with resolving software problem which occurred in Timberjack company, one of the most important loggers in global economy. ",
            "Company top management came across difficult strategic problems concerning software as different patterns of software were used in different regional headquarters which created additional costs and resulted in essential inefficacy. ",
            "That is why it was decided to create general global software framework preventing the risks of software misuse, low coordination and rationalization. ",
            "The software design process which started centered upon creating flexible software which could react to minor and major manufacturing changes. ",
            "There is no denying the importance of the fact that Timberjack came across many difficulties during implementation problems which concerned the choice between different software packages, vendor propositions which not always complied with the interest of company, cleavages between various departments and design teams and customizations difficulties. ",
            "All these is very interesting and helpful in terms of theoretical experience of software systems creation.\n",
            "Problem statement\n",
            "The problem which this case study opens and describes relates to difficult issues concerning manufacturing software development, best available methodology which can be used in this process and positive approaches to coordination between various company\u2019s branches, sectors and departments as well as vendors, project promoters and counterparts. ",
            "For instance, the first stages of software project (outlining its counters and desirable results) created opposition of viewpoints of Sweden team and North American group involved in this project. ",
            "The former thought that it would be more efficient to outline the scope and directions of the software project in just few pages and give it to specialists which would realize it. ",
            "However, the latter, following Coopers and Lybrand methodology thought that it would be best to spend much time for careful examination of all possible impacts and implications for manufacturing process, which will be run by software and finally this viewpoint became predominant.\n",
            "Data analysis\n",
            "The analyzed case gives interesting empirical data on the difficulties concerning organization and realization of software system projects within transnational organization with a joint capital like in this case \u2013 Swedish and American. ",
            "There is no denying the importance of the fact that much of the analyzed data may be used in our future research and practical activities. ",
            "One of the most important directions in this respect are coordination difficulties which should be tackled in terms of constructing joint strategic vision and cooperation. ",
            "This will prevent occurring such problems like in this case when American counterparts say that the Swedish partners received information late because \u2018it was difficult to translate reports from English into Swedish\u2019. ",
            "Besides this the lack of efficiency and understanding resulted in low effectiveness of software project development. ",
            "For instance, as report shows Swedish partners new that Oracle databases cost 40% more in exploitation and customization than Progress databases but it was late since Timberjack already included Oracle databases in the project.\n",
            "Key decision criteria\n",
            "The decision which was finally taken in the case of Timberjack was made on the basis on efficiency and reducing opposition between Swedish and North American partners. ",
            "It was a result of compromise. ",
            "There is no denying the importance of the fact that some elements of software projects were considered as being not functional in Swedish conditions. ",
            "This was due to North American team trying to do such customizations which best suited the interests of manufacturing and operations in the North America.\n",
            "Alternative analysis\n",
            "Alternative analysis which I proposed is based on greater coordination between software groups, better organization of process and designing functional approach to software implementation. ",
            "The current case shows that the task of creating comprehensive software system in Timberjack company proved to be inefficient due to regional peculiarities of business activities. ",
            "Hence, it was difficult to accommodate the changes to software in Europe due to previous software and manufacturing practices and procedures. ",
            "That is why it seems more appropriate functional approach to software system where several subprojects were created within global system, each designed to meet specific regional and operational interests. ",
            "Each project should be influenced by North American or Swedish groups depending on the stakes they had in it. ",
            "In my view, such approach would be effective in avoiding ineffective software use and inflexible global software system in Timberjack.\n",
            "Recommendations\n",
            "* create coordination team on the basis of Sweden and North American group which would design global and regional subprojects on the basis of the bests efficacy in given conditions, operational and manufacturing practices.\n",
            "* Develop appropriate budget and financing policies which will prevent inefficient organization of projects.\n",
            "* Organize effective communication process between involved departments to avoid misguided actions and misunderstanding.\n",
            "Lessons learned\n",
            "Some of the lessons which may be learned from Timberjack mistakes were already mentioned. ",
            "Among others is poor organization of budgeting policies which led to low interest on the part of vendors. ",
            "Besides this, one should mention poor work of company\u2019s computer technology departments which failed to provide adequate information on the difference between Unix and other systems, Oracle and Progress and other elements of software system which essentially effect business processes.\n"

            "The following is legal advice of the Acorn Computers (A) company\u2019s legal position concerning the contractual problem with B supermarkets.\n",
            "It is a general rule that when an offer is made as was done by B supermarkets, the contract becomes binding the moment an acceptance is made by the offeree. ",
            "In this regard, the acceptance is deemed effective the moment it is received by the offeror. ",
            "For this to hold, the offeror should specify that acceptance takes effect when it is received in writing (O\u2019Sullivan and Jonathan 8). ",
            "However, in this case, B supermarkets did not give such a condition. ",
            "On the contrary, they instructed the acceptance to be mailed within fourteen days. ",
            "As a result, the postal rule which is an exception to the general rule applies.\n",
            "According to the postal rule, acceptance is deemed to have taken effect the moment a reply is properly posted and stamped. ",
            "The postal rule supersedes the general rule whenever the reply should be communicated by post. ",
            "It should be noted that the contract will still be binding even when the letter is delayed. ",
            "However, it does not hold when the actions of the offeree cause the delay (O\u2019Sullivan and Jonathan 12).\n",
            "In Adams v Lindsell (1818), an offer was made to sell wool by the defendant and required that acceptance be communicated through the post. ",
            "The plaintiff did reply through the post in time, but the letter was delayed. ",
            "The defendant sold the wool to another person assuming the plaintiff had no interest in the offer. ",
            "The court held that the contract was biding since the plaintiff replied and the date of acceptance was taken to be the date when the letter was posted.\n",
            "In Re London v Northern Bank (1990), it was held that acceptance takes place when a letter is posted. ",
            "In this regard, the day when a letter of acceptance bearing the correct address is deposited in the post box is taken to be the day of acceptance.\n",
            "It should be noted that the offeror has the authority to revoke an offer before the offer is accepted. ",
            "In addition to a letter, the postal rule also recognizes telex and faxes as modes of communication (O\u2019Sullivan and Jonathan 356). ",
            "However, in the case of revocation, the communication takes effect when it is received by the offeree, and not when it is posted. ",
            "Moreover, if the communication arrives outside working hours or when the machine is not on, it will take effect the next working day (O\u2019Sullivan and Jonathan 357).\n",
            "In Henthorn v Fraser (1892), the defendant revoked the offer before receiving acceptance from the plaintiff. ",
            "The Court of Appeal held that since the acceptance had been posted before the revoke was received, the revoke was ineffective and the contract was legally binding.\n",
            "It is important to note that the offer by C to B cannot revoke the initial offer of B because that is a different offer from a different entity. ",
            "For an offer to qualify as a counter-offer, it must be from the offeree. ",
            "In this case, A had accepted the offer by the time the revoke from B was received. ",

            "Computer and Internet Security Notions Essay (Literature Review)\n",
            "Chapter 1. ",
            "Network Security Basics\n",
            "This chapter provides an overview of some of the general computer and Internet security notions; it also explains how a security plan can be created for an institution or an enterprise (\u201cChapter 1\u201d 2).\n",
            "First, some basic concepts and terms related to e-security are defined. ",
            "Then, the problems of security access are discussed; after scrutinizing a number of possible threats and safeguards for information, it is explained that creating a proper physical environment that would allow the data to be safe from physical intrusion is of crucial importance if it is to be protected. ",
            "Next, the issues related to virtual intrusions are considered; these include the prevention of compromise of data occurring due to carefulness or a mistake, deliberate internal breaches of security, and external intrusions carried out by unauthorized individuals.\n",
            "After that, the chapter supplies an overview of threats to network security and the ways to identify them; in particular, the classification of various kinds of attacks is supplied. ",
            "Finally, some important advice on creating a thorough security plan is given. ",
            "It is then summarized that it is useful to be able to understand the motivations of hackers and see the vulnerable surfaces of the organization\u2019s informational system; in addition, the awareness of possible ways of attack is also of crucial importance. ",
            "It is also stressed that, in order to safeguard an informational system, a high-quality security plan should be created and implemented.\n",
            "The chapter provides an easy and effective introduction to network security issues that numerous organizations are forced to face. ",
            "It is important to point out that some most common mistakes related to data security are discussed. ",
            "For instance, it is explained that hackers may operate in an undercover way, working for an organization as cleaners, etc., which allows them to access computers when the employees are not at work, and not to raise any suspicions; it is also elaborated that in many cases the compromise of data occurs accidentally, due to carelessness or a mistake, which means that the personnel of a company should be provided with proper instruction regarding the data safety.\n",
            "Supplying a simple and effective explanation of the basic issues related to network security, this text will be of use to any people who are not professional data security specialists but have a degree of responsibility for their organization\u2019s informational system.\n",
            "Chapter 4. ",
            "AMI Security Requirements\n",
            "The Chapter 4 of Smart Grid Cyber Security Strategy and Requirements provides a detailed account of security requirements that are concerned with Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI). ",
            "It supplies a description of AMI requirements that are modified from the Catalog of Department of Homeland Security so that they can be used for AMI security (\u201cChapter 4\u201d 56).\n",
            "The AMI requirements include a number of components. ",
            "First, the security requirements regarding the cyber protection that are necessary for managing the system and communication protection, which consist of actions done in order to safeguard the components of AMI, as well as communication links between the elements of the system, from a malicious cyber intrusion, are explained. ",
            "Second, the issues related to the management of data and documents are discussed; it is explained that information stored both on hard-copy and digital data carriers and related to AMI is crucial for the proper protection of the AMI elements. ",
            "Third, the conditions for system development and maintenance are described; it is emphasized that organizations are required to comply with the requirements of the federal laws, policies, and directives, as well as with various standards existing in the country. ",
            "Fourth, the chapter provides an explanation of the means that are needed in order to provide a proper response to various incidents; the organizations are obliged to create, spread, review and update documents that regulate both the general policy and the methods utilized in case of such incidents.\n",
            "Fifth, the problems concerned with the integrity of the information stored in AMI are discussed. ",
            "It is stressed that the maintenance of AMI systems should be carried out in a way that allows to maximize the safety of information stored there, i.e. ",
            "to protect this information from being deleted or modified by unauthorized and/or undetected users. ",
            "The controls aimed at such protection are provided. ",
            "Sixth, the issue of access control is addressed. ",
            "It is highlighted that making sure that only the authorized persons have access to the resources in the AMI system is of crucial importance.\n",
            "The possible means of access control include passwords, biometrics, as well as cryptographic tokens. ",
            "Seventh, the problems related to the audit and accountability of the AMI elements are examined. ",
            "It is pointed out that both logging and audit require being carried out in a regular manner so as to ensure that the system is adequately protected, and that all the security mechanisms are working properly. ",
            "It is essential to discover breaches in security and its weak sides if the AMI system is to be safe from threats.\n",
            "It should be stressed that the fulfillment of the requirements provided in the chapter is aimed at allowing for safe and efficient use of the AMI systems. ",
            "Therefore, it is of crucial importance for organizations to comply with these requirements in order to be able to both achieve the organizational goals and satisfy their customers.\n",
            "Network Security: History, Importance, and Future\n",
            "The article by Daya is concerned with the issue of the security of data networks, mainly the Internet and networks with the access to the Internet (1). ",
            "The author examines the problem of network security by analyzing the history of security in networks, the architecture of the Web and its components that can be harmed easily, the kinds of network attacks and means to prevent them, the methods to provide security for different types of networks that have an access to the Internet, as well as the latest developments (both software and hardware) in the security sphere. ",
            "In order to perform the study, the author conducted a literature review.\n",
            "It is stated that in order to provide the security of networks, it is essential to consider a number of factors, namely, access (only the authorized individuals should be able to access the network), confidentiality (the crucial information should not be available to other users), authentication (the users of the network must be confirmed, so that other users might not act using their name), integrity (messages must reach their destination without modifications), and non-repudiation (the users mustn\u2019t deny using the network). ",
            "It is also important to take into account the possible aims of an attack, which might include wasting resources, interfering with the functions of systems related to resources, or gaining information that might be used in the future attacks.\n",
            "The author states that the interest in the Internet security began with a crime committed by Kevin Mitnick in 1995 that resulted in a major financial loss. ",
            "Since the 1990s, when the Internet became public, major studies were carried out in the field. ",
            "Further, the author explains that the vulnerable aspects of the Internet are associated with the Internet Protocol Suite (IPS); to protect different levels of IPS, security mechanisms were introduced, such as a security architecture for Internet protocols (IP).\n",
            "The author also examines the peculiarities of two versions of IPs, namely, IPv4 and IPv6, as well as the most common attack methods on these IPs, which include eavesdropping, viruses, worms, Trojans, phishing, denial of service, and IP spoofing. ",
            "After that, an overview of current mechanisms of network security is conducted; it is stated that the hardware developments are rather limited (they are comprised mainly of biometric systems and smart cards), whereas the software developments are much more significant and numerous, including anti-viruses and firewalls.\n",
            "It should be stated that the article provides an overview of some of the most important issues related to the Internet security. ",
            "On the other hand, the author does not go into much detail in the article. ",
            "It is also important to point out that some of the sources used in the paper are not scholarly. ",
            "Summing up, it might be said that the article can be useful for those who need some rather general information on the topic of the Internet security, but might be of little help to professionals in the field.\n",
            "Impact of Network Infrastructure Parameters to the Effectiveness of Cyber Attacks against Industrial Control Systems\n",
            "The article by Genge, Siaterlis, and Hohenadel is concerned with the topic of cyber attacks on information and communication technologies systems (ICT) (in particular, on networked industrial control systems (NICS)) used by modern critical infrastructures (CI) (675-675). ",
            "The paper scrutinizes the manner in which cyber systems are able to influence the physical world by performing an experimental attack on a CI.\n",
            "In their study, the scholars employed the Boiling Water Power Plant (BWPP) model as an example of a physical process occurring in a CI. ",
            "The researchers supposed that bringing the process to a critical state (critical steam pressure) can possibly cause physical damage to the CI. ",
            "The researchers limited their attack time to 10 minutes because after the start of the attack the personnel of a real CI might notice the significant deviations caused by the attack, and switch the facility off or disconnect it in order to prevent the attack from continuing.\n",
            "The control of the BWPP model, an oil-fired electric power plant, was exercised by using three valves: stream valve, fuel valve, and feed-water valve; the process was monitored with the sensors of water level, steam pressure, and created electricity. ",
            "The attackers used one of the stations located inside the installation\u2019s internal network as their \u201cbase of operations,\u201d for it is known that such stations can easily be compromised remotely from the Internet.\n",
            "The remoteness, on the other hand, means additional complications for the attacker due to packet losses, network delays, etc. ",
            "The \u201cscholarly hackers\u201d attempted to keep the feed-water and the steam valves closed in order to cause the extra pressure (attacker\u2019s valve position, AVP). ",
            "The experimental attacks demonstrated that the hacker can affect the normal valve positions for all the three valves if the programmable logic controllers use the task scheduling frequency of 100 ms, i.e. ",
            "sent a single regular Modbus packet 100 times each second.\n",
            "External factors such as network delays, as well as background traffic, significantly affected the potency of the attacks, but it was still possible to create large deviations from the normal valve position, and thus affect the steam pressure in the facility. ",
            "However, the researchers found out that two key parameters, namely, the control code task scheduling, and the speed of the control valves, were able to significantly enhance the resilience of the physical process under attack.\n",
            "An important achievement of the research is that it examined the influence of cyber systems on the physical world and discovered the ways to increase the resilience of these processes in a CI setting. ",
            "The scholars performed 540 experimental attacks over the span of nine hours, which allows to conclude that the experimental results should be statistically reliable.\n",
            "Cyber Security Challenges in Heterogeneous ICT Infrastructures of Smart Grids\n",
            "The article written by Skopik and Langer is concerned with the subject of security of information technologies used in the management of \u201csmart\u201d power grids (463-464). ",
            "The authors state that in the future, it will be necessary to employ additional sources of energy, not only on the regional or national level but also on-site. ",
            "In addition, more environmentally friendly sources of energy (such as biological, wind, or solar power grids) are much less reliable than the traditional sources (e.g., nuclear or fossil fuel power plants) when it comes to the stability of power supply. ",
            "Therefore, it is important to use modern information technologies to manage the environmentally friendly sources in order to provide stable power supply. ",
            "This opens new surfaces that could be attacked by malefactors, and creates the need for additional security systems.\n",
            "The authors provide an overview of different information and communication technologies (ICT) structures employed in smart grids, examine the main scenarios of cyber attacks on them, and review main security challenges that emerge. ",
            "The methodology employed in order to carry out the research is not discussed, but it appears justified to state that the authors performed a literature review in order to gather the necessary data.\n",
            "The authors explain that the structure of smart grids consists of three main components: grid stakeholders, the physical components of the grid (factories and other facilities), and communication between them (ICT systems; physically, it is realized by power line carriers or fiber optics). ",
            "The authors concentrate on the physical network between the stakeholders and the grid, for these connections may be vulnerable to an attack.\n",
            "Further, the researchers supply information about the possible scenarios that might be employed in order to attack grids; they argue that most attacks will be launched against the metering infrastructure of the grid, because this infrastructure is scattered among numerous users, which makes it an easy target. ",
            "It is also asserted that today these attacks mainly focus on gathering and maliciously using the metering data, or on initiating a dysfunction and denial of service. ",
            "Other possible attacks may include attacks on distributed energy resources, e-mobility (i.e., on grid load management), and on transmission grids. ",
            "Finally, the authors provide a brief overview of the currently existing cyber security standards.\n",
            "It is important to point out that the research deals with a problem that is going to be of crucial importance in the future, and the article provides significant grounds that can be employed to better safeguard not only the sources of the energy supply but also the consumers of energy. ",
            "It is stressed that the future research is required in order to test the discussed scenarios of attack and find the most effective strategies for dealing with them.\n",

            "Playing computer games has always been the thing for all the people who were born in the XX-XXI century; and even though there might be someone who knows nothing about the true delight of playing a PC/video game, most people within that 50-year sphere surrounding video/computer games industry know what I am talking about. ",
            "And, even though I have never been the one for spending nights to win a virtual prize, I was pretty surprised to find myself actually being captured into the virtual reality of one of the most famous computer games in entre world \u2013 the famous The Sims saga. ",
            "Even though it is only now that I can interpret the effects of playing the game for hours, The Sims 3 has definitely proven its value as a great way to train some important skills.\n",
            "I must admit that in my own sandbox, the world seemed incredibly colorful and attractive; filled with adventures and a real exercise for the brain, it had the same effect as a good movie has on the spectators \u2013 it is truly impossible to leave the movie theater until you finally see the climax. ",
            "Even though the designs of the people in the game left much to be desired and most of the characters looked like the Pixar movie rejects, it was still a lot of fun to create my own world and playing God.\n",
            "However, I soon realized that my new \u201cpets\u201d needed a lot of attention. ",
            "I was spending hours trying to create a character and help it build its career so hard that I had completely forgotten about mine.\n",
            "To fight the given problem, I started spending more time in the \u201csandbox,\u201d which was actually the last thing to do \u2013 as a result, I desperately wanted to sleep, but I finally got the Maid\u2019s character right. ",
            "Moreover, I started looking for online cheats, which took all the fun out of the game.\n",
            "Nevertheless, it would be unfair to claim that in my own sandbox, there were only unpleasant things to dig up. ",
            "To my great surprise, I soon realized that The Sims taught me quite a bit about strategic thinking. ",
            "In a couple of weeks, I understood that I could plan my actions and predict their consequences better. ",
            "In addition, I felt more self-assured; indeed, being a god of one\u2019s own universe does add some self-esteem.\n",
            "However, just when I started to feel bored with all those characters that I was in charge of, I found out that the game was finished. ",
            "There was nothing else to do with The Sims . ",
            "Indeed, according to what Forbus says, the functions of the self-proclaimed \u201cgod\u201d in The Sims are quite restricted:\n",
            "Each Sim contains behavior calls for each of the possible social interactions (flirt, kiss, etc). ",
            "When SimSam decides to run the kiss behavior (which is in SimMary) an invisible social interaction object is created. ",
            "The execution of SimSam\u2019s thread is then passed into this object (as is SimMary\u2019s if she\u2019s not busy). ",
            "(Access to the parameters of the chosen Sim is provided through a pointer in the Social Interaction object.). ",
            "(2)\n",
            "With a toy that simple and that time-consuming, it was rather weird that this game took over me completely. ",
            "Anyway, it was a narrow escape for me \u2013 even though the threats of game addiction are considered to be greatly exaggerated, as Vorderer and Bryant explained (Vorderer and Bryant, 332), I would not want to test how addictive they are.\n",
            "Thus, like all good things, my adventure with The Sims finally came to an end. ",
            "And, taking account of this travel, I must admit that it did have its pros and cons. ",
            "On the one hand, is it has been mentioned previously, the game did teach me a lot of important skills, especially the ones concerning motor function and memorizing essential things, as well as keeping in mind a lot of crucial information.\n",
            "In addition, I have acquired strategic thinking and the capability of thinking fast and efficiently. ",
            "To add up, I got pretty interested in the way all these characters work, which probable served as the final argument for learning a couple of things about compute design. ",
            "According to Tobias and Fletcher, computer games can help even surgeons, developing their skills and offering a decent simulation for real surgery (Tobias and Fletcher, 54), which makes the chances of everyone playing simulation games to train the corresponding skills. ",
            "However, it is also worth mentioning that the game did take a great lot of time which I could have spent in a more useful way.\n",
            "Moreover, constant playing the game could have made me dependable on playing computer games; luckily enough, I do not have any desire to start another computer adventure (unless Maxis offers the next part of the Saga instead of the despised spin-offs, which very unlikely). ",
            "Thus, I am quite even with the Maxis and have escaped the sandbox without suffering great losses.\n",

            "Computer Hardware Acquisition and Vendor Policies\n",
            "Just like any acquisition of expensive equipment in the school, purchasing computer hardware is more or less the same. ",
            "Computer hardware programs have to generally meet the needs of a particular school, and therefore the vendor has to be a significant consideration before acquiring any of them. ",
            "It is good to avoid mistakes that come as a result of the wrongful acquisition of special computer equipment.\n",
            "In most cases, such mistakes may lead to failure to use the hardware in a manner that substantiates its cost. ",
            "This would mean that the school will have made an error by paying too much for the hardware in which they end up not using it properly. ",
            "This section of this paper seeks to argue for the need for considering the manufacturer of the hardware before purchasing it to avoid mistakes.\n",
            "Hardware programs are essential in the running of the entire school computer systems. ",
            "This includes the finance, registration, students and staff records, examination and also in the teaching and learning process. ",
            "Acquiring computer hardware without following a vendor policy is similar to putting the fate of the entire school computer system in the hands of a sales person, which a wrong thing to do in any organisation.\n",
            "Buying computer hardware from a sales person would also mean that the school will have to incur extra costs that are usually hidden. ",
            "This includes installation cost or configuration cost and support cost. ",
            "Manufacturers usually ensure that the organisations\u2019 needs are met by customising the computer hardware programs to fit their goals. ",
            "It is also easier to upgrade the hardware programs when the purchase is made through a manufacturer. ",
            "This means that the manufacturer will always be updating the school of any available upgraded version of the hardware program, making it possible for the school to be more satisfied.\n",
            "Compatibility concern is one other issue that should cause a school to have vendor policy for the purchase of its computer hardware. ",
            "There could be specific hardware programs that are not compatible with a particular operating system or software. ",
            "Dealing with the particular vendor directly would help the school avoid mistakes such as the ones mentioned above. ",
            "It creates an environment where the school and the manufacturer will be on the same page when it comes to responsibilities for specific actions.\n",
            "It is possible that with the manufacturer, the school can stick with what it wants and has. ",
            "For instance, once the school has defined its priorities and needs in a functional term, then the vendor can quickly be involved in coming up with the right hardware that will assist the smooth running of the school system. ",
            "Therefore, the challenge that the school has is to identify a trustable vendor who understands the technicalities within the school environment.\n",
            "The partnership with the vendor is not supposed to end the moment when the school purchases the computer hardware. ",
            "This partnership continues for a longer duration as long as the school and the vendor remain in good terms. ",
            "The relationship depends on whether the vendor can handle servicing of the hardware programs whenever required by the school. ",
            "They do not have to send an outsourced company or group to do their responsibility of maintaining the hardware programs, especially during the valid period of the warranty.\n",
            "The vendor policy within my school district is such that for any vendor to do business with any of the schools, then there are essential obligations that they have to follow. ",
            "First of all, they have to handle all communication process with the schools through the assigned school representatives. ",
            "Through these representatives, the vendors have to communicate issues to do with available updates for any of the computer programs both software and hardware, advice on public services and products that will improve on the already existing ones and give suggestions for an effort that would benefit both the school and the vending company.\n",
            "Hardware purchase policy\n",
            "The primary purpose of this policy is to enable the school to have restrictions for the purchase of any new computer hardware. ",
            "The policy helps a lot to assist the purchaser only in being limited under the confinements of the school IT budget. ",
            "Equipment of a specific standard is always a recommendation that any school would have. ",
            "This policy sets down the particular standards for Information technology equipment that each school within a district needs to have.\n",
            "The vendor has to be in agreement with the school to accept equipment configurations that are stipulated in the policy. ",
            "This helps in improving pricing of the supplies and hardware equipment to both the school and the purchaser. ",
            "It also assists the school administration to avoid more overheads. ",
            "The school will incur less maintenance cost and better support for the equipment they have purchased if the policy is put in place.\n",
            "Before making any purchase, there are specific hurdles that have to be completed for the purchase to be approved. ",
            "The first hurdle is the standardisation of the hardware. ",
            "According to the school hardware purchase policy, standardisation is not entirely restricted.\n",
            "Purchase of nonstandard hardware component can occur but should at all times be minimised. ",
            "To justify the purchase of such non-standardised hardware equipment, there should be an exceptional circumstance for its immediate requirement. ",
            "For instance, the school cannot approve any purchase of non-standardised hardware equipment without indication of how it will be supported and who is responsible for supporting and maintaining the equipment.\n",
            "The other hurdle is the review of the vendor to be involved in the acquisition of the hardware equipment. ",
            "The school is responsible for reviewing the performance of the company before engaging in any transaction with the vending company. ",
            "Such action is aimed at benefiting the in various terms. ",
            "It will help the school to see the cost of the products that they intend to buy from the manufacturer and also see how reliable the product is and if there is need for any servicing to be done regularly. ",
            "According to the policy, once the purchase has been made, the school is also entitled to continue with the product review after every six months.\n",
            "There are several evaluation categories in which the performance of the vendor will have to be subjected both before purchase and after the purchase. ",
            "These categories include cost, the time of acquiring the equipment, performance of the equipment, and reliability of the equipment. ",
            "However, the categories are not limited to only these four mentioned. ",
            "The third and final hurdle requires paper work and procedural matters. ",
            "Before any purchase, some forms have to be filled and several people whom the forms have to pass through to append their signatures.\n",
            "Policy for software evaluation and selection\n",
            "When it comes to software purchase, several ways can be employed to evaluate the software. ",
            "Delgano identifies three categories that can be used to assess instructional software programs. ",
            "These categories usually form the basis of most software evaluation policies for many schools and school districts. ",
            "The software must be able to cater for input technique, cognitive task and system response.\n",
            "The software must be understood exclusively for purposes of instruction, in as much as software programs are suitable for teaching and creating the necessary connection that the student requires relating to real life. ",
            "However, this can only be achieved if the instructor plays a role in guiding the students as they interact with the software.\n",
            "There are challenges and hurdles that arise during the evaluation process of the software. ",
            "The first challenge concerns defining the educational outcome that the software tends to provide. ",
            "It is hard to identify the competency level of the software program and how it is useful in giving the exact intended goal. ",
            "The best way to overcome this challenge is by testing the program with the students and at the same time without the students.\n",
            "This will enable educators to be in an excellent position to make a decision to purchase the software program or not. ",
            "This means that piloting for instructional software is necessary. ",
            "If the vendor of the software does not provide a piloting version or a trial version for a demonstration, then the chances are high that the program may not meet the objectives and goals of the school.\n",
            "Measuring of intended outcomes is the other major challenge that is usually witnessed during the process of evaluation and selection. ",
            "This challenge is preceded by the challenge of defining the results. ",
            "But once the outcome has been determined, then measuring it would be an attainable task. ",
            "This challenge can be overcome by testing the software on the students. ",
            "Most of the instructional software programs have students test after every tutorial session. ",
            "If the students are able to get the test questions and other instructional objectives of the tutorial sessions, then the program can be prejudged to be worth purchasing.\n",
            "Overcoming this challenge will ensure that the program is tested for validity and reliability. ",
            "The software program has to be able to refine the skills of the students and at the same time, develop a new essential life skill that the students will identify with in real life. ",
            "It may not be possible to measure everything that is required because educational measures are restricted to observable skills only.\n",
            "Thirdly, a challenge will arise when it comes to accounting for the impact of delivery that the software program will have to both the instructor who will be entitled to use it and the students. ",
            "The software program will be flawed under one condition; if it is unable to create a clear distinction and separate the impact, it has on the delivery methods and educational methods. ",
            "It is known that instructional strategies have to make the necessary motivation that the students require in order to enhance teaching and learning. ",
            "Using the educational software program must meet the objectives of instructional methods and have a positive impact on the delivery of instruction.\n",
            "If a comparison is made between the lectures conducted in a class by the tutors and the sessions in the software programs, one thing will come out clearly. ",
            "This is that the methods of instruction will be the same, but the practices of delivery will differ. ",
            "In other cases, the software programs will give a difference in both the delivery methods and in the instructional strategies. ",
            "This difference is mainly due to the nature of both the two methods of instructions.\n",
            "In the first method, the lecturer does not have to be patient with the instructor, but in the latter case, the computer program is self-paced. ",
            "It is argued that computer programs do not entirely improve learning among learners. ",
            "What media- and computer-based learning does to the student is that it alters the efficiency of cognitive learning. ",
            "This alteration is usually on the positive side where the student will be in a better position to grasp what the software program intends for learning purposes.\n",
            "Lastly, there is the challenge of coming up with practical problems for designing learning requirements. ",
            "This is where the teachers play an essential role in identifying the required practical issues for the students. ",
            "Before coming up with educational software, the process has to involve several stake holders to make a comprehensive thing that will be appreciated by all. ",
            "It is not enough for the software programmers to code the software without the appropriate content that will be beneficial for the students in the instruction process.\n",
            "Teachers have to be involved because they are the right people with the right content and instructional method required for the effectiveness of the software programs. ",
            "During the evaluation and selection process by a school, these five challenges will be the main things that they have to overcome in order to select an appropriate program for their school. ",
            "These same challenges apply even when it comes to hardware selection and purchase. ",
            "The evaluation has to be a successful process and to achieve this then the\n",
            "Technology fa\u00e7ade checklist\n",
            "Technology fa\u00e7ade is an assessment program that is used to identify whether a school has an outstanding computer program or not. ",
            "It consists of a series of questions that aimed at assessing the status the technology within a particular school. ",
            "The section of this paper is an analysis of a field experience in which I conducted in the school in which I work. ",
            "The first section of the assessment was checking on the use of technology within my school.\n",
            "Technology use is a common thing in the school that I work in. ",
            "For instance, it is not only computer teachers who are left with the work of using school computers. ",
            "Each and every teacher in the school is entitled to be computer literate and also use the help of computer-based instructional programs to deliver the content of the lesson. ",
            "I noticed that being able to use a computer in this school is an added advantage for the appointment of any new teacher.\n",
            "There are several teachers who have lost their opportunity to be part of the esteemed teaching staff of this school because of their inability to simply operate a computer. ",
            "Almost everything is done with a computer including the marking of some test, delivering assignments, students\u2019 evaluations and reporting.\n",
            "The computer facilities of the school are usually made available, especially to the students during periods in which they have free time such as recess. ",
            "The facilities are only locked up for security reasons at night when everyone has left the school. ",
            "This means that during regular operational hours, the students can use the facilities, especially internet services for research and other learning purposes. ",
            "There is a school computer lab that is enough to accommodate 100 students at a time.\n",
            "And this facility is usually opened to the students. ",
            "There is also wireless internet connectivity in which staff and students with portable computers can use to access the internet from any point of the school. ",
            "Each classroom has a computer which is typically operated by the class teacher. ",
            "The computer is connected to the entire school network system, and it has the records of all the students in the class.\n",
            "In most cases, the teachers in the school would use technology for grading the students, preparing their lessons, giving the students out of class assignments and for professional development. ",
            "For instance, there are teachers who never write assignments on the board but refer students to the department page of the school website to look for an uploaded task. ",
            "There are several computer-based lessons that the students regularly have, such as web quests.\n",
            "During the web quests, the tutor only provides links to specific sites where the students will find necessary information for the particular task in which they are required to accomplish. ",
            "Such exercises are essential to the student for enhancing research skills and presentation skills because at the end of it all they will have to use PowerPoint presentation to organise their findings.\n",
            "Another common thing with the software found in the computers is that they are regularly updated so that they meet the changes that continuously occur with the curriculum. ",
            "The software vendors are usually up to speed in providing the updated versions of their software. ",
            "Some of the updates have to be downloaded from the internet, and this even makes it more comfortable since the updates run automatically.\n",
            "The second section of the analysis concerns the necessary infrastructure. ",
            "It is not just enough to provide the technical resources required for teaching. ",
            "There are several infrastructures that are needed to go handy with these technological devices. ",
            "For instance, teachers have to be trained in using the different technological tools including the computers in order to save on the cost of having a specialist who serves the purpose of guiding the students through the various programs.\n",
            "The different stakeholders are all actively involved in the school development and technology committee. ",
            "This committee is essential in sensitising the need to use technology for instruction. ",
            "Technology is a big priority in the school, and funding for it is one of the areas that have to receive budgetary allocation each and every year. ",
            "There are also programs that the administration uses every semester to recognise and appreciate teachers who embrace and use technology in their classes for teaching and learning. ",
            "The school has a clear and well-articulated technology plan that clearly states the mission, vision and motto of the school with regards to technology. ",
            "From the overall rating of the school, it can be concluded that it has a satisfactory technology program.\n"

            "However, the enabling nature of the internet means that people can use the internet to perform malicious activities, one of which is distributing ransomware. ",
            "With the increasing adoption of digital hospital records and the introduction of computerized order prescription systems, ransomware may pose a serious threat to people\u2019s lives.\n",
            "Ransomware is a type of malware, a piece of software that secretly installs on a computer and disables a user\u2019s access to files stored on its hard drive. ",
            "While I knew about the existence of ransomware before, I was surprised to learn that hospitals and other public organizations became the victims of cyber-criminals. ",
            "Indeed, one would think that due to the sensitivity and importance of the information stored in digital medical records, hospitals would implement strict security measures to protect its systems from ransomware. ",
            "However, the news report by PBS NewsHour suggests otherwise.\n",
            "There is no denying that computerized medical records and order prescription systems have numerous benefits. ",
            "In fact, in the previous video, such technology was described as one of the components of the improved healthcare safety net. ",
            "However, the implementation of such technology in a hospital setting requires special attention to be paid to security protocols. ",
            "Personnel should be forbidden to download any attachments from third-party emails, and USB-drives on hospital PCs should be locked for security reasons. ",
            "Ransomware can only be installed by the user; it is just that the user is sometimes not knowing that the attachment they download is ransomware. ",
            "Another security measure is disabling administrative rights on hospital PCs, thus eliminating the opportunity for any malware or ransomware install.\n",
            "I do not believe that hospitals and police departments are specifically targeted by criminals. ",
            "At 5:50 mark the narrator says that criminals cast a wide net in the hope some inexperienced user will download and install malware (\u201cRansomware attack takes down LA hospital for hours\u201d). ",
            "Typically, public organizations have strict security policies and do not allow employees to download and install any files. ",
            "Some organizations even have company-wide firewalls that block any download and installation attempt or require special authorization for the installation to begin. ",
            "As such, I believe that while UAE hospitals might be at risk, the risk is quite low and can be minimized through comprehensive security measures. ",
            "As such, the issue at hand is not the ransomware, rather, the irresponsible hospital management did not establish security measures to protect its systems from malware.\n",
            "It is also important for personnel to understand the risks. ",
            "While implementing computerized medical records and order prescription systems managers should educate personnel about the consequences of downloading attachments from third-party emails, and doing any other activity which might compromise system security. ",
            "Strict policies should be established, and random security checks organized to establish high levels of security.\n",
            "Hospital information systems are an emerging technology and as with any emergent technology, its implementation may come across some roadblocks. ",
            "One of these roadblocks is ransomware and the issue of security of these systems in general. ",

            "While the compute deals in the manufacture of hardware goods such as computers, it also deals in the software part that involves networking. ",
            "Under this networking sector that was established in 1985, the firm has been involved in a series of innovation. ",
            "The firm aims at providing the best innovations that can solve key issues affecting the changing business industry across the globe. ",
            "In order to attain this, the firm has undertaken measures to incorporate environmental sustainability measures. ",
            "This paper discusses the effectiveness of HP\u2019s computer networking from a strategic point of view to the structural point of view.\n",
            "Effectiveness of HP\u2019s Computer Networking Business: Strategic Management\n",
            "According to HP Networking (13), HP is one of the dominant firms in the networking sector because it has capitalized on a networking innovation to create a competitive edge over its competitors. ",
            "The firm has been able to achieve excellence in networking because it focuses on innovation as the most important strategy. ",
            "Due to innovation, HP has been able to develop best networking solutions such as the E-series that are manufactured under the ASIC power series. ",
            "The other is the ProCurve manager that is user friendly and manageable by all users. ",
            "Strategically, HP uses the game theory to analyze the reaction of its competitors regarding the manufacture of a new networking product. ",
            "Under this strategy, the firm capitalizes on the first mover advantage to be the first to develop efficient networking solutions and sell in the market.\n",
            "In addition to these strategies, HP utilizes other strategic management techniques such as the Lean manufacturing strategies (Lean six sigma) and the marketing strategies. ",
            "While lean six sigma ensures quality in the manufacturing process, marketing strategies ensure that the market is aware of the firm\u2019s networking products. ",
            "It has marketed its products online together with allowing online purchases and deliveries.\n",
            "Effectiveness of HP\u2019s Computer Networking Business: Structural Management\n",
            "The effectiveness of HP networking business could also be analyzed using the firm\u2019s structure. ",
            "HP is characterized by a mechanistic organizational structure that has its management centralized in one location. ",
            "The mechanistic structure is necessary for HP given its large size. ",
            "With such a structure, the firm is highly specialized with the networking and other section being allowed to manage internal affairs. ",
            "There is a clear chain of command that is characterized with a narrow span of control. ",
            "The centralization of the organization\u2019s management is significant because it increases standardization of manufacturing tasks, and establishment of a good working culture.\n",
            "To the good organizational structure, there is speedier decision making process in the firm with the employees such as the sales representative on the ground having a clear chain of command on who to report to regarding the sale of the products or in cases of inquiries and issues. ",
            "The organizational structure can be attributed to the good performance of the networking section of HP since enhances completion of various activities, setting of goals and ensuring efficiency in the innovation process. ",
            "As noted by Chama (9), high efficiency and effectiveness go hand in hand and they ensure attainment of set objectives.\n",

            "The ProCurve network and securities channel is designed by the firm to benefit HP, its partners and consumers. ",
            "The program is expanding and it is vital that it separates form the initial TSG. ",
            "The autonomy of the networking will come with its management and sales representatives together with experts that develop the system. ",
            "This will reduce the bureaucracy undertaken to reach the right person and relay information on consumer needs and issues. ",
            "In addition, autonomy of ProCurve will help the networking section to specialize and therefore increase its efficiency and effectiveness, which is closely related to increased revenue. ",
            "Given that the level of competition in the industry is high, autonomy of ProCurve will create a competitive edge for the firm. ",
            "On the contrary, the independence of ProCurve will mean that the section will no longer receive much support form TSG as it has been before, but will have to ensure that it is profitable to sustain itself.\n",
            "Recommended Strategies\n",
            "Centralization and manufacturing of products from a single location is not cost effective for HP. ",
            "The firm needs to minimize costs through outsourcing and off-shoring of its vital services to various countries that can offer services cheaply. ",
            "U.S. ",
            "is capital intensive while other countries such as India and China are labor intensive. ",

            "The internet has revolutionized business and there are many system users online. ",
            "HP should capitalize on electronic marketing of its networking products and allow consumers to purchase online. ",

            "Much like the invention of the telephone, the creation of the Internet has launched a series of arguments regarding its role in everyday life of common people. ",
            "Some claimed that it was a magic pool of incredible opportunities; others insisted that it was a Pandora\u2019s Box that would make people even lazier. ",
            "As it always happens, the truth seems to lie somewhere in the middle between these statements.\n",
            "Despite the fact that social media clearly poses a tangible threat to the culture of live communication and, therefore, will contribute to the shriveling of people\u2019s social skills, computer mediated interpersonal and intercultural communication will allow for creating a stronger bond between the representatives of different cultures and brings the effects of prejudice down even among the members of communities where cultural, national and ethnic diversity is rather low.\n",
            "The fact that new media offers better opportunities for multicultural experiences cannot be viewed as either a positive or a negative effect of social networking \u2013 at least, it cannot be positioned as such on its own. ",
            "Modern media should be viewed as a tool that can be used for educational, professional and personal purposes.\n",
            "While the fact that more people are capable of learning about other nationalities and having unique communication experiences with them is definitely far from negative, its effects should be mentioned to define the value of the given phenomenon.\n",
            "The first positive effect to be mentioned, in fact, has a lot to do with education. ",
            "As it has been stressed above, modern media open a pool of opportunities for multicultural education, which is, in fact, a direct result of diversity and multiculturalism principles having their effect on various aspects of people\u2019s lives. ",
            "Traditional methods of learning and teaching can, thus, be mixed with the ones that are widely accepted in other cultures, yet are positioned as innovational in the recipient one.\n",
            "For example, social networking may help students learn a particular subject, such as the English language. ",
            "Creating a specific group in Facebook where one can post exercises, rules and tips, or a Twitter group, where one can post short comments regarding the language, its specifics, students\u2019 success and impressions can be of great effect for ESL students. ",
            "More to the point, the tips on how to connect Facebook posts with \u201ctwits\u201d already exist, which means that, when combined together, several social networks and other computer media may have an even greater effect on students\u2019 progress.\n",
            "When it comes to defining the positive aspects of computer mediated communication, one might want to mention better education opportunities for those engaged into the communication process. ",
            "In other words, students learn faster and in a much more efficient way in a multicultural environment, which communication via computer programs provides a chance for. ",
            "For example, in every culture, there is a unique way of approaching students based on whether the local culture is based on visual, aural, or verbal approach.\n",
            "As Samovar, Porter and Stephani explain, the culture of Native Americans is based mostly on visual elements of communication, which means that most Native American students are visual learners. ",
            "Hispanics are classified as aural learners. ",
            "Hmong, in their turn, have developed impressive aural skills, since they \u201cdo not have written language\u201d (Samovar, Porter & Stephani, 1998, p. ",
            "209).\n",
            "Thus, students will be able to develop not only their major skill, whether aural, visual, or verbal, but also train the rest of the aforementioned skills, which will help them in their further learning process, as well as in conversations with the representatives of other cultures, whose vision of the world is based on the principle other than the one of the person in question. ",
            "In the realm of computer media, where each of the three types of cognition is introduced, combining them in order to create the ultimate environment for studying is shockingly easy.\n",
            "According to Samovar, Porter and Stephani, multiculturalism, which social networking promotes actively, will also contribute to the evolution of learning and motivation styles in education.\n",
            "While the effects of introducing new means to cognize one\u2019s own manner of learning may vary, and \u201cteachers should be aware of what they \u2018bring\u2019 to the classroom\u201d (Samovar, Porter & Stephani, 1998, p. ",
            "217), in most cases, students adapt easily towards new learning environment and accept the new rules rather eagerly if the latter are offered to them in the right manner. ",
            "Providing an opportunity to get in touch with the people living in the most remote corners of the earth, modern media definitely help achieve the given goal.\n",
            "Another crucial element that social networking and other computer media provides to the people of the present-day world, a chance to develop emotional intelligence must not be overlooked, either (Bandura, 2005). ",
            "One of the pivoting stages of a person\u2019s evolution, the development of emotional intelligence is also boosted greatly by modern media.\n",
            "According to what Wood says, emotional intelligence is an \u201cability to recognize feelings, to judge which feelings are appropriate in which situations, and to communicate those feelings effectively\u201d (Wood, 2013, p. ",
            "168).\n",
            "By introducing the principles of multiculturalism into the classroom with the help of social networking and other types of new media, teachers can help students broaden the horizons of their emotional intelligence by learning about the types of responses accepted in other cultures for similar contexts. ",
            "Promoting multiculturalism, such social networks as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, etc. ",
            "contribute to emotional intelligence development greatly.\n",
            "As Lustig and Koester explain, enhanced by the \u201cinteraction sequences that are repeated over and over again\u201d (Lustig & Koester, 2012, p. ",
            "275), or social episodes, emotional intelligence also plays a huge role in personal and professional evolution. ",
            "It is worth noting, though, that the variations of social episodes for a particular situation had not been in existence up until recently, when an opportunity to engage in computer mediated social interactions emerged.\n",
            "True, it is unnatural for a particular culture to have several variants of interaction sequences for a certain situation; as a result, an alternative pattern of interactions represented by the people belonging to another culture could easily spark a conflict between those involved. ",
            "For instance, the notorious women\u2019s rights issue often happens to be a major source of conflict in a communication between the residents of patriarchal and democratic states (Mookherjee, 2008).\n",
            "With the advent of social networking and the ability to cognize the specifics of other cultures, however, the number of social episodes per situation has grown for a number of people, which means that emotional intelligence rates have been increased unbelievably all over the world. ",
            "With the help of computer mediated communication, emotional intelligence growth can be boosted impressively.\n",
            "When communicating via Twitter, Facebook, Skype, or any other type of modern media, people learn quickly that other patterns of reacting to a certain event exist and that, though they do not have to be followed necessarily, they have the right to exist.\n",
            "Unfortunately, computer mediated communication also leads to a number of negative outcomes, the unwillingness to participate in live communication and, therefore, losing the basic skills of a live conversation being the key one. ",
            "When it comes to defining the key specific of computer networking, the lack of nonverbal communication elements always takes the first prize as the most notorious one. ",
            "True, there is Skype, and, with a webcam, it is possible to see the vis-\u00e0-vis and their reaction towards what the opponent says.\n",
            "However, a webcam offers only a part of nonverbal information that an everyday live communication provides in that a webcam can only capture a single frame, while, in an old-fashioned live conversation, people are capable of choosing their own angle to look at their vis-\u00e0-vis at. ",
            "Thus, a huge chunk of data is wasted for nothing in the course of a computer mediated communication.\n",
            "More to the point, it is questionable whether communication can actually take place without its nonverbal component. ",
            "Therefore, with all its positive aspects, computer mediated communication still needs improvement, which, in its turn, will be achieved with the invention of new options for social networking.\n",
            "Even though the lack of nonverbal communication is an obvious flaw of the present-day computer media, it still helps address one of the most notorious issues that exist on par with the rest of the realities of the XXI century. ",
            "Seeing how some cities and even states suffer from the lack of cultural diversity, a favorable environment for breeding all sorts of national, cultural and ethnic stereotypes is created. ",
            "Thus, the premises for misunderstandings on interpersonal, intersocietal and intercultural levels emerge.\n",
            "The multiculturalism environment created in the course of an interpersonal and intercultural computer mediated conversation, in its turn, provides the means to prove these prejudices wrong and turn over a new leaf in intercultural and international relationships.\n",
            "Thus, it becomes possible for the participants of the communication process to share their unique experience in learning, therefore, creating an entirely new way of knowledge acquisition. ",
            "With a blend of several approaches based on the features of several different cultures, one is most likely to come up with a highly efficient method of learning. ",
            "In fact, the given strategy can possibly lead one to shaping the qualities required for lifelong learning.\n",
            "Although computer mediated interpersonal and intercultural communication has rather negative effects on people\u2019s ability to engage in real life communication, it clearly helps promote cultural diversity among every single person that has an access to modern media and partakes in the process of social networking. ",
            "It would be wrong to deny the obvious problems that social networking and other types of modern media have; however, their advantages are far too big not to notice the, either.\n",
            "One of the most important effects of modern media, introduction of cultural and ethnic diversity to a number of people and even communities that lack one clearly allows for not only cultural, but also political, economic, financial and educational progress of a number of states.\n",
            "By sharing their experience and introducing each other to a whole new world of different traditions and sociocultural norms, people will be able to solve a number of intercultural and international conflicts, as well as enhance cooperation between countries all over the world.\n",

            "Computer Hardware: Past, Present, and Future Essay\n",
            "To a great extent, the development of computer hardware illustrates the technological and scientific progress achieved by people in the course of world history. ",
            "This paper is aimed at discussing the definition of this term hardware, its history, current development, and prospects.\n",
            "It seems that the discussion of these questions can throw light on the evolution of information technologies, and the main factors that influence this process. ",
            "Overall, one can identify several important trends that profoundly affected the development of hardware, and one of them is the need to improve its design, functionality, and capacity. ",
            "Secondly, it is important to remember about the increasing commercialization of these technologies.\n",
            "First of all, the term hardware can be defined as physical units of a computer that are supposed to perform the processing, input, storage, transfer, and output of information (Stair & Reynolds, 2011, p. ",
            "62). ",
            "Among these elements, one can distinguish processors, keyboards, hard disk drives, motherboards, graphics adapters, scanners, printers, and so forth (Stair & Reynolds, 2011).\n",
            "These units have to do separate tasks, and one cannot say that they are equally important; yet, they are closely dependent on one another (Stair & Reynolds, 2011). ",
            "Overall, this concept of hardware is used to describe the tangible components of a computing system. ",
            "In contrast, the word software refers to intangible elements of a computing system, and they are used to manipulate the hardware. ",
            "This is one of the distinctions that should be taken into consideration. ",
            "On the whole, this term is critical for the understanding of information technologies and their functioning.\n",
            "The importance of hardware can hardly be underestimated because it ensures that every process is completed successfully. ",
            "Furthermore, the physical units are important for the effective work of software applications and operational systems. ",
            "Finally, these components are used to connect different computing systems.\n",
            "Scientists have long tried to create a machine that can process information or store it; for example, the famous mathematician Blaise Pascal was able to create a mechanical calculator in 1642 (Singh & Nath, 2007, p. ",
            "59). ",
            "Similar attempts were made by other mathematicians, but it is very difficult to call these inventions computers because they consisted only of mechanical elements (Singh & Nath, 2007).\n",
            "More importantly, their functionality was very limited. ",
            "One can say that the true development of computing systems began in the first half of the twentieth century and at that time, this hardware had to serve military needs (Singh & Nath, 2007, p. ",
            "61). ",
            "In particular, one should mention the model introduced by John Von Neumann who believed that computers had to include such elements as CPU, input and output devices, and memory storage (Singh & Nath, 2007, p. ",
            "61). ",
            "To a great extent, this model contributed to the future development of hardware.\n",
            "It should be noted that in the course of history, computer hardware gradually became smaller and more effective. ",
            "For instance, the Colossus computer occupied an entire floor of the building, while modern computers can be smaller than a notebook (Singh & Nath, 2007). ",
            "To a great extent, the need to minimize hardware became one of the most important trends, and this requirement is considered by many designers and engineers.\n",
            "Moreover, the improvement of hardware components led to the greater commercial use of computers or its components. ",
            "Today, they can be regarded as mass consumer goods that are accessible to people of different incomes. ",
            "This is one of the issues that should be taken into account.\n",
            "Currently, the development of hardware is based on several important principles. ",
            "First of all, manufacturers attempt to make their devices efficient in terms of energy consumption, size, and compatibility with existing software solutions. ",
            "These are the most important concerns of engineers and designers who have to work various requirements when developing new products. ",
            "To some degree, the improvement of CPUs, Random Access Memory (RAM) and other devices reflects the development of existing software solutions that require the excellent performance of technologies. ",
            "This is one of the most important trends that one can identify.\n",
            "Additionally, the physical components of a computer are adjusted to different devices that were not previously related to computing systems. ",
            "For instance, Random Access Memory can be easily incorporated into mobile phones. ",
            "Apart from that, the physical components of the computer become are improved in terms of their capacity and connectivity. ",
            "For example, contemporary hard-disk drives can store several terabytes of data. ",
            "This capacity was hardly imaginable at least a decade ago when users had fewer opportunities.\n",
            "Moreover, a hard-disk drive can be connected to a variety of devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, and even TV sets. ",
            "These are some of the issues that one can identify. ",
            "Overall, it is possible to argue that the development of computer hardware continuously brings new opportunities to people.\n",
            "At this point, it is very difficult to predict the future of hardware development, because a single discovery or invention can significantly contribute to technological progress. ",
            "Apart from that, it can make previous hardware completely obsolete. ",
            "Moreover, it is very difficult to appreciate the value of an invention. ",
            "For example, very few people could predict that the Internet would turn the world into a global village.\n",
            "Similarly, the discovery of liquid crystal was not initially connected with computer hardware, but now they are widely used for the production of displays. ",
            "One can make several conjectures about future trends. ",
            "First of all, the researchers point out that the speed and efficiency of hardware tend to double every two years (Giaretta, 2011, p. ",
            "131). ",
            "This tendency was observed during the last two decades (Giaretta, 2011, p. ",
            "131). ",
            "This means that in the future, the functionality and performance of hardware will rise dramatically.\n",
            "Moreover, it is possible to say that the size of different hardware components will significantly diminish (Giaretta, 2011, p. ",
            "131). ",
            "Finally, the hardware, which is now believed to be innovative, may go out-of-date within five years. ",
            "These are the main arguments that can be put forward. ",
            "One can say that the development of hardware will offer new opportunities to users.\n",
            "These examples suggest that in the course of its history, computer hardware has undergone significant transformation due to technological and scientific discoveries. ",
            "Although at the very beginning, it was used mostly for military purposes, the situation changed dramatically in the second half of the twentieth century when computers began to serve commercial goals and turned into consumer goods.\n",
            "Moreover, it is very difficult to predict future changes that information technologies will undergo. ",
            "Additionally, different elements of computer hardware will be improved in terms of functionality, performance, and design. ",
            "Finally, different components of a computer can become obsolete very quickly. ",
            "Overall, by looking at the historic development of computer hardware, one can better understand technological progress and its future trends.\n",

            "From the case study, it is evident that customers of Euro Computer Systems (ECS) are upset due to an underperforming Order Fulfillment Center (OFC) as demonstrated by the delay in the delivery of computer terminal components to them.\n",
            "The customers\u2019 complaints are justified because the order fill rate (completed orders filed on time) is 43 percent, implying that most customers have to contend with the problem of getting the highly specialized components long after the computers are delivered.\n",
            "An effectively operating OFC should have the capacity not only to meet specific ordering and distribution needs as demanded by customers, but also to ensure cost savings and substantially reduce customer complaints.\n",
            "Description of Current Process and Problems\n",
            "The current process in the OFC is largely manual-based, and involves generating the orders on a weekly basis, dating the orders and putting them in an Order Bin located in the order processing area, entering the numbers from the order form into the computer to identify the location of terminals, pulling out the terminals if available, and taking the terminals into a central processing location called the dock for onward shipping (see Figure 1).\n",
            "The problems with the current process are nested in (1) the use of different means to locate the terminals and forward them for onward shipping, and (2) the lack of uniformity in the recording of order shortages.\n",
            "Order Generation Figure 1: Process Flow Diagram\n",
            "General Changes\n",
            "The terminals requested by customers are highly specialized due to security concerns, hence the decision by management to implement a low stock policy not only to minimize inventory costs but also to lower the costs involved in discarding obsolete terminals. ",
            "Consequently, a short term change to improve performance could be to streamline the process involved in the recording of shortages with the view to substantially reducing the amount of time taken to replenish the inventory for missing orders.\n",
            "A long term change could be to fully computerize OFC not only to harmonize the different avenues presently used to locate the terminals from the inventory area but also to ensure that stocks are replenished as soon as possible to meet customer demands. ",
            "Consequently, the performance in the OFC could be measured in terms of achieving a high order fill rate (above 80 percent), ensuring the stored inventory can successfully meet customer demands without elevating cost overruns, and also maximizing customer satisfaction levels.\n",
            "Additional Information for Complete OFC Redesign\n",
            "A complete redesigning of the OFC process to improve performance needs much more information than is currently available. ",
            "For example, the information on the availability and nature of inventory needs to be availed to inform efficient replenishment practice. ",
            "The information filled on the order card should also be availed to shed light on how missing orders are documented and who is responsible for ensuring these components are replenished at the earliest convenience.\n",
            "Additionally, information on what has already been computerized, and what is done manually should be availed to assist stakeholders in deciding what more should be computerized to improve efficiency and performance. ",
            "Lastly, information on all the employees/players working in the OFC and their specific roles should be provided to ensure seamless integration of all processes and activities with the view to substantially reducing customer wait times after making an order.\n"

            "For a long period, people used to think that globalization is something urgent that cannot be neglected. ",
            "It was necessary to strive for some global improvements, promote innovations, and gain a new portion of knowledge in the possible fastest way. ",
            "Nowadays, innovations in information technology become affordable for many people, change their sizes, and open a whole new world of opportunities for people at home, work, or school.\n",
            "Still, there are many groups of people who are not satisfied with the effects globalization brings to society. ",
            "People cannot understand the essence of the globalization process as they cannot understand what globalization can make. ",
            "Globalization becomes a problem because people do not want to spend more time and define its pure nature, its purposes, and abilities.\n",
            "This is why the experts, for example, the IT representatives and all whose, who get their Computer Information System degrees, should make use of their knowledge and practices and provide society with clear and credible explanations of how useful the effects of globalization can be.\n",
            "In fact, globalization is the process that speeds up the interactions between people from different parts of the world, stretches out the relations of different levels and makes it possible that the decisions of one country have certain consequences in another country, and provides each as well as some huge corporations with a kind of cyber freedom.\n",
            "There are many reasons to believe that the forces of globalization affect the future of the world in a variety of ways. ",
            "People want to believe that globalization is something that can change their lives for better. ",
            "At the same time, people cannot trust this process as they are not always able to gain control over it. ",
            "Thomas Friedman introduces a powerful statement that \u201cglobalization has gone to a whole new level\u201d (The World Is Flat 9).\n",
            "He also underlines the fact that the relations between globalization and the information technologies have gone \u201cfrom connected to hyper-connected\u201d (\u201cA Theory of Everything (Sort Of)\u201d para. ",
            "3). ",
            "In other words, the investigations of this writer show that globalization gains different qualities and new characteristics. ",
            "And Friedman\u2019s main point is that all these changes were taking place \u201cwhile I was sleeping, and I had missed it.\n",
            "I wasn\u2019t really sleeping, but I was otherwise engaged\u201d (The World Is Flat 8). ",
            "It is possible to give many explanations of why people are not able to follow all the changes brought by globalization: weak opportunities, laziness, unpreparedness, etc. ",
            "However, it is also necessary to remember that globalization presents a number of new possibilities that seek to close technology gaps (Kemeny 2).\n",
            "This is why the analysis of the issue concerning the relation between globalization and, for example, information technologies is one of those open-ended questions that cannot be provided with one particular answer.\n",
            "Key points and evidence offered by different researchers as well as personal investigations and the evaluation of the current situation and the prospects of the future career help to understand that the search for alternatives and the analysis of globalization from different perspectives is one of the most appropriate ways that can be chosen.\n",
            "There are many interesting opportunities to prove that globalization may have a positive effect on the future of any career, and the career of an IT expert as well. ",
            "The only thing that is required is a personal desire and faith that globalization can lead helpful and affordable ideas.\n",
            "Friedman says that there are all chances to make globalization \u201cworkable, sustainable, and fair for more people\u201d (551). ",
            "His experience and real-life stories explain that globalization may become a problem in case it is wrongly understood or taken in a bad time. ",
            "However, it does not take much time and efforts to change the situation, evaluate new possibilities, and make use of globalization to succeed in a future task or action.\n",
            "Globalization is rather beneficial due to the possibilities available to different people. ",
            "Thanks to Skype, children can support real-life communication with their parents from different parts of the world. ",
            "Thanks to Twitter, absolutely unknown people may share information. ",
            "And thanks to Google, it becomes possible to find any kind of information about anything. ",
            "Nowadays, it is hard to imagine our life without such devices like iPads, iPhones, cheap Internet, notebooks, etc.\n",
            "All this is possible due to the process of globalization, and people should not forget about it. ",
            "All they need is to pay attention to the offered alternative and spend more time analyzing this process and its offers. ",
            "The future careers of the students, who are going to get their Computer Information System degrees, are able to open a charming world of globalization to many people. ",
            "Such experts should be ready to find a link between an ordinary person, his/her needs, and a technology that may be used to improve life.\n",
            "In general, globalization should be regarded as a problem. ",
            "It should be used as an amazing opportunity to change this life and use the facilities that can help. ",
            "Of course, much work has to be done to comprehend the essence of globalization and its effects on different spheres of life.\n",
            "Friedman\u2019s work aims at explaining that globalization is a very insidious thing that has to be treated properly. ",
            "Personal knowledge and experience show that globalization may be properly understood and explained by good specialists. ",
            "There is no need to make definite conclusions about globalization and treat it as pure good or bad thing. ",

            "The effect of computer-assisted cooperative learning methods and group size on the EFL learners\u2019 achievement in communication skills\n",
            "The study points at the effect of the computer-aided cooperative learning method and the group size on EFL learning achievement in communication competency. ",
            "It begins by providing the merits of small groups that accomplish tasks together, including the strength of language use, promoting mastery of language use, increasing participation by individuals, and providing a conducive environment for learning.\n",
            "However, demerits may include group conformity patterns that sometimes do not respond to wishes of the individuals, opposition to group ideals that may be treated with suspicion and rivalry in small groups with vested members\u2019 interests. ",
            "Loyalty to the group may lead to some members acting modestly to avoid victimization by other group members. ",
            "Based on this fact, efforts were made to aid learning by eliminating the physical barrier.\n",
            "The assumption was that mistrust breeds conflict due to potential arguments; thus, the study on group behavior sought to counter hindrance in group\u2019s behavior by employing techniques that hid identity to compare learning conduct in different settings. ",
            "This was possible through the introduction of computer-based settings that helped in developing communication skills.\n",
            "In this case, the instructor uses hidden electronic secrets, which target students in mutual groups to conceal their identity. ",
            "The methodology used involved drawing participants from English undergraduate class at All- Bayt University Jordan. ",
            "The design involved random sampling that targeted two groups, positive interdependence versus the mutual model. ",
            "Participants were assigned to two groups; one was known, and the other was anonymous.\n",
            "They were then assessed to determine their scores in English exams. ",
            "The study also factored demographic characteristics such as age, nationality, and sex. ",
            "The results show that individuals who cooperate in learning are likely to have higher scores than those who are independent.\n",
            "This is attributed to the group\u2019s identity role that is instilled in mutual groups, ownership of groups success amongst members, level playing ground during groups meetings, equal responsibility allowing individual accountability, and spirit of competency due to individuals identifying with the task delegated, thus allowing responsible action.\n",
            "The study is good, as it highlights the significance of computer-aided cooperative learning and groups in acquiring communication skills. ",
            "The study explains the concept of positive interdependence that accustoms group members to a uniform culture with a view of accounting for behavior. ",
            "On the contrary, a different group allowing individuals to account responsibility predicts behavior in comparison to the group.\n",
            "The study examines mutual learning in computer-based settings and groups structure. ",
            "The methodology applied suited the study since it allowed for comparisons between two groups in different environments, which help to understand performance with a view of predicting behavior. ",
            "The findings are good and specific, as they reiterate the importance of groups in learning.\n",
            "From the findings, we cannot underestimate the role that groups play in promoting individuals\u2019 learning. ",
            "This is probably due to the sense of competency that is reinforced when learners become immersed in groups that identify with vision and mission of their formation, allowing a culture of conformity to group norms that are likely to contribute to the achievement of goals.\n",
            "The findings can be inferred to understand group behavior in any typical setting. ",
            "They share the same features to enhance the group\u2019s success as shown in the Japanese model that initiates a culture of conformity to group norms, thus improving workers\u2019 performance.\n",

            "The study sought to establish which ESL writing mode between the computers networked and traditional method enhanced writing well. ",
            "The findings showed that students\u2019 engagements increased gradually with the assistance of networked computers in writing classes. ",
            "Students were able to engage freely and participate by commenting on discussion topics, thus eliminating a distraction to students who wanted to be creative.\n",
            "Also, teachers had easier access to students\u2019 writing in class that promoted immediate feedback and followed up on students\u2019 progress. ",
            "Unlike networked computers, traditional classes were found to be a barrier to both teachers and students who had difficulty in comprehending the accents. ",
            "It is also worth noting that networks allowed students to view each other equally, encouraged students\u2019 participation, and reduced teacher-students physical contact.\n",
            "The aim of the study was to establish if word processing in networked computers enhanced writing. ",
            "Also, the study sought to establish the extent to which networked computers encourage student participation and reduce teachers\u2019 instructions, especially in enhancing grammar. ",
            "The methodology in the study involved 69 students who were recruited from departments that were meant for ESL students during the winter and spring.\n",
            "This involved two categories of students comprising 34 Students in networked classes and 35 students in the traditional classes. ",
            "Participants were chosen from different faculties majoring in different fields within the university that cut across junior and senior students, although initial targets were students in their first year of study. ",
            "The study finding showed that several factors contributed to the best quality of writing work in networked classes.\n",
            "The results of the study showed that networked computers were likely to promote better student writings, which would further be enhanced via observation, taking risks, and through reinforcements by the teacher and peer students. ",
            "This highlights the importance of conducive environments that promote learning, which has an impact on improving the quality and quantity of writings.\n",
            "The findings further stated that students in networked classes had a more optimistic attitude during the beginning of the semester than their counterparts in the traditional classes, which had a significant impact on the gains of networked computers.\n",
            "Despite the positive attributes of networked computers in ESL writing classes, it is important to note that they are learner-centered and focus on word process and revision. ",
            "Moreover, changing from traditional writing to using computers that have been networked is costly since it requires technical expertise.\n",
            "The study was good as it sought to establish the role of networked computers in enhancing writing in an ESL class. ",
            "The importance of this study can be justified by the fact that networked computers actively encourage students\u2019 interactions, unlike the traditional mode of writing. ",
            "Although the traditional mode of writing encouraged face-to-face discussions through visual aids, it was disadvantageous to students with no mastery of physical cues.\n",
            "The methodology used was suitable since it eliminated a bias by relying on a variety of respondents across the various faculties thus it could be stated that the findings were an equal representation of respondent in all the Academic fields.\n",
            "These findings are specific and can be applied in different learning settings to show the role that external aids play in influencing the learning outcome. ",
            "Technology offers an advantage in learning by eliminating physical barriers that are likely to hinder inventiveness due to its practical approach to learning.\n"

            "The Drawbacks of Computers in Human Lives Essay\n",
            "Since the invention of computers, they have continued to be a blessing in many ways and more specifically changing the lives of many people.\n",
            "However, in as much as computers have changed the way people live and do things, it must also be emphasized that they are associated with negative effects. ",
            "This paper, therefore, discusses the negative effects or drawbacks of computers in the lives of many people. ",
            "In trying to explore this issue, the paper will also mention what proponents of computers say before refuting it.\n",
            "Although many people may argue that use of computers help in enhancing education especially through research, when it comes to young people the reality is different. ",
            "Use of computers reduces quality study time (Lin and Jin 411). ",
            "That is to say, chatting, gaming and other social related software are highly tempting in the eyes of young people.\n",
            "As a result, this significantly eats into their study time. ",
            "In the end, the effort he or she may devote to education is virtually insignificant. ",
            "In short, for a nation or its people to reap a sizeable output out of something is to invest heavily. ",
            "Therefore, spending less time on education-related matters can affect one negatively in the future.\n",
            "Computers tend making people be over-dependent (Bowers 115). ",
            "That is, instead of thinking as it was the norm before computers were invented, people today can just find answers without difficulty on the Internet.\n",
            "Additionally, spending more time on the computer can easily cause health effects like eye strain, mental disorders, and shortsightedness. ",
            "What is more, according to psychological studies, being on computers for a long time can as well lead to depression and anti-social behavior, and this is mostly associated with young persons (Kassin, Fein and Markus 601).\n",
            "Using computers affects the social lives of people. ",
            "This is based on the fact that human beings are social animals and they live in a society that is highly interactive (Lin and Jin 411). ",
            "That is, sharing his opinions, beliefs and ideas with other people play a very important role in his life. ",
            "However, computers have completely cut him from this kind of life. ",
            "He or she is completely isolated from the events of the real world.\n",
            "In fact, he or she becomes slowly changed to becoming a machine that is lifeless. ",
            "He or she just like computers will eventually start perceiving things in the context of numerals and numbers. ",
            "In short, this argument does not underestimate the importance of computers.\n",
            "In fact, computers can easily create unimaginable things and support man to reach the intended level of success. ",
            "However, if not managed well, it can as well be the start of something whose end results may be dangerous.\n",
            "The power a computer has over human beings is mesmerizing. ",
            "Use of computers on a daily basis can easily lead people to commit atrocious crimes that have a negative effect on the natural environment. ",
            "For instance, people are used to same things like socializing with the same people. ",
            "Besides, people always want to do things that they are restricted.\n",
            "The bes,t example is the tendency to access various sites or carry out certain activities malware, hacking, and even spamming, which are characterized as offenses under the law.\n",
            "Moreover, the risks involved in talking with unknown people online or strangers have negatively affected the life of many people in the past. ",
            "With this, the world must come to the realization that what people need is not a potential killer but something that contributes to the general development.\n",
            "Whilst computers have a lot of benefits such as making clerical and computational work easy. ",
            "It is undeniable that spending many hours on a computer may easily lead to idleness. ",
            "As a general fact, laziness reduces the self-respect of the person (Cash and Smolak 446).\n",
            "Laziness prevents someone from realizing and exploitation his or her innate skills. ",
            "In fact, the approach that is slothful in nature is known to weaken the body making it unable to function properly. ",
            "Therefore, in as much as computers have really changed the way people do things, but it also comes at a huge cost.\n",
            "Even though most users of computer argue that it enhances communication and accessibility of information worldwide. ",
            "They further argue that computers provide conveniences when it comes to using various programs like accounting programs, Microsoft Office and PowerPoint. ",
            "The truth of the matter is that dependence on computers reduces one\u2019s outlook.\n",
            "Indeed, anyone who has been using or who has ever used other machines like typewriters understands the advantages that come with computers when it comes to heavy workloads. ",
            "However, the argument here is that a prolonged usage or staying in front of a computer for a long time destroys one\u2019s sense of intrinsic knowledge to that he or she can obtain from the Internet.\n",
            "This makes him or her less responsive to real life activities whilst he or begin nearly all things as simulated. ",
            "With this, someone can easily be labeled as an introvert or even contemptuous. ",
            "His or her life remains tightly held on an imaginable line, that is, hanging somewhere between appearance and reality.\n",
            "Computers negatively affect one\u2019s creativity. ",
            "This is because when people want to write assignments these days, they can easily \u2018copy-paste\u2019 someone work although is professionally illegal. ",
            "The argument is that technology has greatly affected the thoughts to a point where they cannot afford to carry out some additional studies on their own.\n",
            "Every human being is born with skills that are inherent and ingenious. ",
            "Channeling creativity in a proper way can take people far. ",
            "In any case, intelligence is not just about relying on the works which belong to other people. ",
            "Intelligence entails making use of one\u2019s abilities to provide new information to the world as well as helping in organizing the proper or solid base to accomplishment.\n",
            "The argument here is that, in so doing, one\u2019s insights and thoughts could be of great help to a developing nation when compared with the resources offered by computers. ",
            "In short, the present day computer era is highly limiting the flow of idea and thoughts.\n",
            "In conclusion, in as much as computers are highly acclaimed for what they have done and what they continue doing, the computer is associated with many drawbacks that negatively impact human life. ",
            "As it has been seen from the discussion, computers reduce people into mere machines making them unable to do any work without them.\n",
            "Not enough, computers are associated with dangers such as psychological diseases, crime, laziness, lack of creativity, impact on social life and reduction in outlook. ",
            "The list is not exhaustive as computers are still being used and these continue to affect people in different ways.\n",

            "Implementing Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in EFL Classrooms Analytical Essay\n",
            "The Internet and modern technologies have changed the nature of learning. ",
            "Thousands of teachers throughout the world consider computer-aided learning as a kind of dream that will bring only positive outcomes. ",
            "The implementation of the computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in EFL classrooms can be rather a challenge.\n",
            "Many scientists have conducted researches aiming to investigate the impact, problems, and efficiency of CALL in EFL classes. ",
            "According to Afrin (2014), the computer is becoming an integral part of every classroom nowadays. ",
            "The Internet and CALL are not the only modern approaches that alter the traditional educational procedures.\n",
            "CALL modifies the role of both the teacher and student in the process of language learning drastically. ",
            "In fact, CALL presupposes the language learning and teaching with the help of additional resources such as the computer, the Internet, and other computer-based sources. ",
            "The author dwells on several significant advantages of CALL.\n",
            "These benefits include motivation, adapting to learning, authenticity, and the development of critical thinking. ",
            "However, it can be rather a challenge to integrate CALL into classrooms. ",
            "As Alkahtani (2011) states, there are three levels of CALL integration. ",
            "Integration at the institutional level includes the purchasing of equipment, the formation of technical support, and providing the access to it.\n",
            "The second stage is the integration at the department level. ",
            "Department should formulate their policies to maximize the efficiency. ",
            "The third level includes the integration by teachers. ",
            "Teachers should receive necessary knowledge and skills to implement CALL in the EFL classrooms.\n",
            "The implementation of CALL in EFL settings should enhance the learning outcomes of learners and facilitate the meeting of needs of both pupils and teachers. ",
            "Nevertheless, the problem with teachers\u2019 attitude exists. ",
            "Naeini (2012) writes that \u2018teaching staff have always been encouraged to integrate computer and the Internet into their classrooms, but very few have practically responded positively\u2019 (p. ",
            "9).\n",
            "Despite teachers\u2019 attitudes, several other barriers impede the successful implementation of CALL in EFL classrooms. ",
            "These barriers include the lack of financial support, availability of hardware and software, the insufficient theoretical and technical knowledge (Lee n.d.). ",
            "Jager et al. ",
            "(2014) emphasize the importance of the combination of the computer-based language learning with face-to-face learning.\n",
            "They introduce the idea of blended EFL e-learning. ",
            "In most cases, teachers assume that they realize pupils\u2019 needs while it is not always so. ",
            "The implementation of CALL should fill the gap between teachers\u2019 assumptions and students\u2019 needs. ",
            "Finally, it is significant to evaluate some practical results of the implementation of CALL in EFL classrooms.\n",
            "Knowledge of sufficient amount of words is always a problem of students who learn English as the foreign language. ",
            "The results of several types of researches and experiments indicate that the usage of CALL enhances the vocabulary acquisition. ",
            "Students process information efficiently via computer-aided resources.\n",
            "It results in a long-lasting remembering of words (Ghabanchi & Anbarestani 2008). ",
            "Listening skills are also of extreme significance for foreign language learning. ",
            "Most EFL students face difficulty in recognizing the foreign language in everyday conversations between native speakers. ",
            "Phuong (n.d.) provides the information concerning the implementing of CALL for the promotion of listening skills in EFL learners in Vietnamese Universities.\n",
            "The author pays attention to the fact that teachers who have studied necessary information concerning CALL and have changed their attitudes are more likely to teach pupils efficiently. ",

            "iPad\u2019s Design Framework\n",
            "The iPad\u2019s entry into the market signaled a new era in Human-Computer interaction. ",
            "It came with enhancements that have revolutionized how man interacts with computers. ",
            "The concept of Multi-touch moved touch screen technology many steps forward.\n",
            "Some of the novel interaction features of the iPad, which were not previously in the iphone, include the spread-or-pinch feature, bundle creation, and page navigation. ",
            "The iPad\u2019s iPhoto application allows for expansion or closure of a pile of photos as part of its new multi-touch interactions through a spreading or pinching motion applied by two fingers. ",
            "It is also possible to make piles out of multiple slides in order to move or delete them.\n",
            "This involves selecting the first slide, then holding it, and then tapping on the rest of the slides. ",
            "The slides form a bundle, which is now ready for movement to a desired location.\n",
            "This applies to mail where the user can form bundles of mail for mass deletion. ",
            "In addition, a page navigation function included in the iPad allows a user to preview the contents of a page before opening it by pressing and holding the scroll bar area. ",
            "It brings up a viewer through which the destination page is previewed.\n",
            "Two functions, currently enhanced in the iPad, that were already in use in the iPhone are the scrolling tabs and the contextual keyboards. ",
            "The scrolling tabs feature allows for shifting from one tab to another while the contextual keyboards displays a keyboard relevant for the application in use.\n",
            "For instance, it brings up a numeric keyboard for input of numeral based functions such as time input and mathematical calculations, while a text-based keyboard appears for input of text based applications such as messaging.\n",
            "Music is one of the popular iPad uses, supported by numerous iTunes applications. ",
            "Several apps meet the various needs users have ranging from the creation of music to playing it. ",
            "One of the applications used to create music that is benefiting from the bigger multi-touch screen is the Groovemaker app. ",
            "There was a previous release for use with the iPhone.\n",
            "However, it had a practical limit as to how effectively one could use it because of the iPhone\u2019s smaller screen. ",
            "The purpose of the Groovemaker is \u201cbeat-making\u201d. ",
            "It works by sequencing loops from a huge library and forming layers to make a track. ",
            "The main control is by drag-and-drop, which allows a user to easily pick desired tracks and remove undesired ones.\n",
            "The bigger screen now allows users to control up to eight tracks simultaneously, a feat not possible previously. ",
            "After creating the music, it allows for exportation to a computer. ",
            "There are three options for the application, house, hip-hop, and Drum \u2018n bass, depending on a user\u2019s preference. ",
            "It is available in the different packs in the iTunes store, with a free release pack and other enhanced packs, costing at least four dollars.\n",
            "The iPad fits the description of a bigger iPhone because it came with many of the apps that were present in the iPhone, while providing enhancements to take advantage of the new capabilities of the iPad. ",
            "Edge and Faas (2010) confirmed this when they said, \u201cMost applications that run on the iPod Touch and the iPhone can run on an iPad\u201d. ",
            "An iPhone user would easily recognize the apps used by the iPad.\n",
            "When compared to the MacBook, the two devices\u2019 designs are for different uses, which complement each other. ",

            "The computer game industry is now one of the fastest growing industries worldwide. ",
            "Millions of people play various computer games. ",
            "Clearly, children and teenagers are major users of these products but there are many gamers among adults as well.\n",
            "There is a wide range of games and genres, each person chooses a game or even a virtual world to his/her liking. ",
            "Some people are too absorbed by the virtual world and computer games become an addiction.\n",
            "Nonetheless, it is rather an issue of the human psychology than of the product, as only certain people prefer the virtual to the real world.\n",
            "Players as Moral Beings\n",
            "It is necessary to note that ethics and morality of computer games have been a focus of scholarly research for a number of years (Ford, 2001). ",
            "Researchers state that the virtual world is a moral world and, hence, players are moral beings.\n",
            "This assumption is justified by the fact that there are some rules in games and players follow those rules, which creates a certain moral paradigm (Sicart, 2005). ",
            "An example of such moral rules is the peculiarity of many games where players cannot destroy players of their team or other characters (for example, hostages) (Sicart, 2011).\n",
            "Therefore, it is possible to state that players are moral beings that have a specific code of conduct and this code creates the bonds and makes up a community.\n",
            "Product Placement in Computer Games\n",
            "Obviously, being a multibillion industry, computer games are seen as a world of many opportunities for advertisers. ",
            "Product placement has become quite a common thing for cinematography and television. ",
            "It is clear that such type of media as computer games can also be of interest to advertisers.\n",
            "Product placement is quite appropriate when it comes to advertising aimed at adults. ",
            "However, there can be certain ethical issues related to advertising aimed at children. ",
            "Clearly, in such games, product placement should be minimum and developers of games have to be very responsible (avoid advertising potentially harmful products).\n",
            "Are There Gender Differences?\n",
            "It is possible to note that virtual worlds that have been created are very diverse. ",
            "They respond to needs and aspirations of different groups of people. ",
            "Of course, there are certain gender differences in this sphere as well.\n",
            "Sicart (2011) notes that the majority of virtual worlds are dominated by males, and females who also want to enter the world and participate in its creation may face certain difficulties (for example, some kind of discrimination, lack of support or communication and so on).\n",
            "However, there are various worlds where females are dominating (Sims can be seen as one of the examples of the game for females). ",
            "Males prefer action and creating stories (races, shooting, analysing positions) while females prefer storytelling and details (adventures, searching for details, creating worlds).\n",
            "Honour among Gamers\n",
            "Since it has been acknowledged that virtual worlds are moral, it is but natural to assume that there is honour among gamers. ",
            "Sicart (2005) argues that there is a certain honour system among participants and co-creators of virtual worlds.\n",
            "Each game (each virtual world) has a set of rules that are expanded by gamers and these rules constitute the honour system of the particular game. ",
            "It is necessary to note that these sets of morals are often employed in the virtual world only as many people create alter egos when playing games (Ford, 2001).\n",

            "With the reduction of the sizes of the computers, software development has followed the same trend.\n",
            "An operating system (OS) \u201cis an integrated set of programs that is used to manage the various resources and overall operations of a computer system which is designed to support the activity of a computer\u201d (Das 2010, p. ",
            "88). ",
            "A team of programmers work together with microprocessor engineers to design a set of programs that work together to avail various resources of a computer.\n",
            "In fact, the most important part of the computer is the operating system. ",
            "While a typical boot process doesn\u2019t call the operating system right away, it hands over to the operating system before any real work can be done (Watson 2008, p. ",
            "60). ",
            "Despite the fact that a computer system constitutes of the hardware, live ware and software, the operating system is the most important software that the computer system must contain.\n",
            "The operating systems have been developed from time to time. ",
            "The major differences in the operating systems revolve around the interfaces each operating system use. ",
            "There are three major types of interfaces namely: command driven, menu driven and graphical user interface based operating systems. ",
            "In the market today, there are a number of operating system software developers.\n",
            "The most common personal computer operating system software developers or operating systems are: Windows by Microsoft Corporation, Mac by Apple computers, Solaris by Oracle, Linux and others. ",
            "Old operating systems like MS DOS were command driven types of operating systems which are not reliable because of the difficulty encountered in remembering the commands.\n",
            "The menu driven operating systems were an improvement of the command driven operating systems. ",
            "This led to the invention of the graphics interface based operating system. ",
            "Operating systems have two modes namely, user mode and the Kernel mode. ",
            "The user mode is what the human being interacts with while the Kernel mode is what interacts with the computer hardware.\n",

            "Rationale behind the monopoly\n",
            "From the information above, Microsoft Windows has taken the largest market share in operating systems. ",
            "Jain & Khanna (2010, p. ",
            "77) argue that, \u201c\u2026 pure monopoly is a market structure in which a single firm is the sole producer of a product for which there are no close substitutes\u201d. ",
            "With this definition and the market share of the Microsoft Windows operating system (about 85% average), it is enough ground to state that \u2018it has a monopolistic market share.\u2019\n",
            "Now the question in mind is how the corporation has managed to retain its market share for long. ",
            "Most businesses engage in dubious means of maintaining their monopoly in the market, is it so with Microsoft? ",
            "It is argued that, \u201cMicrosoft has engaged in a carefully designed and extremely successful campaign to protect and extend its monopolies.\n",
            "Microsoft has repeatedly made market allocation proposals to its competitors and has used a broad range of other anticompetitive and unlawful tactics to eliminate potential rivals, including tying, predatory product design, and intentional deception\u201d (Schestowitz 2009, p. ",
            "93). ",
            "Most of these activities may sound lawful but they are not. ",
            "Reports indicate that Microsoft makes about 77% profit every year from its two main monopolistic products namely: Windows Operating system and Microsoft Office suite.\n",
            "Reasons why it is believed that Microsoft is using uncompetitive techniques\n",
            "The reasons why Microsoft is using anticompetitive practices in order to have dominance in the market are quite elaborate. ",
            "Microsoft tried their best to eliminate a number of applications that are used to accomplish day to day activities. ",
            "The applications are: web browsers, office application packages, DOS and media players.\n",
            "Microsoft also used other methods to discourage sale and development of other technologies. ",
            "These allegations are explored below so as to support the fact that Microsoft uses anticompetitive practices to maintain a monopoly in the market share.\n",
            "First, Microsoft worked hard to eliminate the Netscape browser with its Windows explorer. ",
            "In 1996 Netscape\u2019s group Chief Executive Officer said, \u201c\u2026 Microsoft\u2019s strategy for Windows and Internet Explorer involved nothing short of eliminating Netscape\u2019s Navigator\u201d (Pride & Ferrel 2006, 112).\n",
            "Together with other CEOs from other firms they complained that Microsoft was anticompetitive and violated federal antitrust laws because it sold Windows with a reinstallation of Windows Explorer. ",
            "The fact that everybody who bought and installed Microsoft Windows had no choice but to install Windows Explorer as well was a cause of alarm. ",
            "The Windows Explorer is uninstall-able hence, the conclusion that Microsoft wanted to limit its users to its products only.\n",
            "McKenzie & Lee (2006, p.18) indicates that, \u201cIn 1998, the Justice department took Microsoft to court for violation of antitrust laws. ",
            "\u2026the justice department maintained that Microsoft was a monopolist as evidenced by its dominance in the market share in the operating system and Microsoft was using \u2018predatory\u2019 pricing of its internet explorer\u201d.\n",
            "With the entire public outcry and the fact that Microsoft Windows Explorer was being sold as inbuilt software, was truly reason enough to conclude that Microsoft was using anticompetitive practices in order to sustain a large market share.\n",
            "Secondly, Microsoft had to make sure that Word Perfect is eliminated by the introduction of Microsoft Office suite. ",
            "It indicated that, \u201cMicrosoft launched an anticompetitive campaign to extinguish WordPerfect, an office productivity application owned by Novell and competing with Microsoft\u2019s Office suite\u201d (Fergusion, 2002).\n",
            "In fact Bill Gates (Microsoft Founder and group CEO) stated that, \u201cI have decided that we should not publish these [Windows 95 user interface] extensions. ",
            "We should wait until we have a way to do a high level of integration that will be harder for likes of Notes, WordPerfect to achieve, and which will give Office a real advantage\u2026. ",
            "We can\u2019t compete with Lotus and WordPerfect/Novell without this\u201d, (Schezowitz, 2011).\n",
            "With this campaign Word perfect gained popularity but in retaliatory, Microsoft came up with measures to suppress it. ",
            "For instance, Microsoft required that Novel must improve their technology in order to avoid incompatibility. ",
            "Microsoft also narrowed the marketing opportunities of Novel by use of OEM licensing. ",
            "As time went by, Microsoft office gained ground and Word perfect virtually disappeared from the market.\n",
            "Thirdly, Microsoft introduced a Per Processor license fees. ",
            "Original Equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are manufacturers of computers with preinstalled operating systems. ",
            "Since these companies bought the operating systems from Microsoft and others, Microsoft required that each computer shipped has a license for the operating systems.\n",
            "This was uncompetitive to other operating systems. ",
            "In fact, it later emerged that, \u201cIn 1994, the U.S. ",
            "Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) filed an antitrust suit against Microsoft challenging this conduct, resulting in a consent decree under which Microsoft agreed to stop using per processor license fees\u201d (). ",
            "Clearly at this point Microsoft admitted that it was using an uncompetitive technique and withdrew from some of its activities.\n",
            "Microsoft went on to eliminate other commonly used software. ",
            "Microsoft\u2019s introduction of the Windows media player was a way of trying to avoid exposing their API. ",
            "Media players are middleware products that expose APIs to software developers which were the worry of Microsoft.\n",
            "The fact that, \u201cmiddle ware could reduce the application barrier to entry by serving as an applications, taking over some of the platform functions provided by Microsoft and thereby weakening the applications\u2019 barrier of entry\u201d, (Shelaniski 2003 p. ",
            "223). ",
            "This was a major concern for Microsoft.\n",
            "This was the big reason why they had to introduce as many middleware in their operating systems so as to avoid the risk of exposing their code. ",
            "The best way it combated this was by tying its media player with the operating system which gave users no reason to look for other media players. ",
            "This was also an anticompetitive idea that Microsoft used to protect its operating system.\n",
            "The server systems were no spared as well. ",
            "According to Mowery (1996, p. ",
            "9), \u201ca server is a software program, or the computer on which that program runs, that provides a specific kind of service to client software running on the same computer or other computers on a network.\u201d With this definition, it is clear to note that an operating system on a personal computer on a network needs to send a request to the server computer.\n",
            "Again, the request sent must be understood by the server operating system. ",
            "In this regard, Microsoft decided to \u2018punish\u2019 other server software developers by making their operating system incompatible. ",
            "This clearly is not a good practice to software development because it slowed down the development of other server software.\n",
            "This seems to have worked well for Microsoft since it is the most popular server operating system to date. ",
            "However, the desire to make it only compatible to Microsoft products was reduced drastically. ",
            "This has enabled development and slow growth of other server software.\n",
            "An operating system works with an underlying microprocessor; that is why there is a strong relationship between Microsoft and Intel and AMD. ",
            "Since Intel was the most acceptable microprocessor during the inception of Microsoft systems, there was enough reason for Intel to cooperate with Microsoft. ",
            "With this in mind and the aggressiveness of Microsoft to protect its market, it organized collective boycott against Intel.\n",
            "One of Intel\u2019s main goals was to develop a Native Signal Processing System (NSP) that would enable the customers enjoy, \u201c\u2026 robust multimedia systems at lower prices because NSP in many cases would eliminate redundant expensive multimedia add-in cards\u201d, (InfoWorld Jun 5, 1995). ",
            "This did not go down well with Microsoft and they decided to define their own development environment that would thwart the plans of Intel, which is sabotage.\n",
            "In conclusion, Microsoft has managed to keep its market share at an extremely high value of 85% average. ",
            "Its browser Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office suite are leading in market share as well. ",
            "The means it uses are dubious but somehow Microsoft is cleverer to maintain that they are within the specifications of law.\n",
            "However, it has also failed in applications it has developed. ",
            "The Windows version Vista is considered to have failed because it did not reach the market as anticipated. ",
            "This was witnessed by users sticking to using Windows XP rather than the new and fancier version Vista. ",
            "Microsoft also developed and Antivirus that could only be used on computers running its operating systems but they did not get the popularity they expected.\n",
            "The behavior of Microsoft for the last two decades has illustrated its willingness to participate in unlawful conducts that extend its dominance in the market. ",
            "As a result of this practice, consumers in the market are bound to use the same products with little room for innovation if the same was to be in a competitive market.\n",
            "If authorities were to closely monitor the trends of Microsoft\u2019s monopoly from the beginning, they would stop them from manipulating the market. ",
            "The latest measures taken by European Commission to curb Microsoft misbehavior is seen by many people as the start of stopping Microsoft participating in anticompetitive behaviors for the long term.\n",

            "Information needs for business managers tend to be similar for most businesses when one considers the same level of management. ",
            "There are usually three levels of managers whose information needs are slightly different from each other.\n",
            "These include operational managers, middle managers, and executive or senior managers. ",
            "Computer-based information systems provide the information needed by the aforementioned categories of managers, which assists them in their work. ",
            "The following are the information needs of the three categories of managers.\n",
            "Operational managers usually benefit from such systems by getting all the information related to the short-term or daily operations of the organization. ",
            "For instance, the computer-based information system provides such managers with information related to attendance of employees, shifts of employees, and so forth. ",
            "Such information helps operational managers make structured business decisions.\n",
            "On the other hand, middle management benefits from a computer-based system by getting managerial or tactical information. ",
            "The middle-level managers use this information to make short plans or decisions. ",
            "Such information includes annual production details or even quarterly sales analysis.\n",
            "The information also helps them supervise the operational level by giving managers specific activities that they should perform. ",
            "Lastly, computer-based information systems help senior management make decisions. ",
            "The systems provide these managers with strategic information, which the managers use to make strategic or unstructured decisions.\n",
            "Such decisions may include setting the objectives and policies of the enterprise. ",
            "The information they get also helps them to manage other managers within the organization. ",
            "Senior management gets information from the system detailing trends in costs incurred by the enterprise or even the revenue trends.\n",
            "With this kind of information, senior managers can make decisions aimed at increasing revenues and reducing the costs incurred by the enterprise.\n",
            "An e-business strategy is an elaborate plan that an organization develops detailing how it intends to conduct its business over the internet. ",
            "Most people wrongfully view the strategy as just internet business. ",
            "However, the e-business strategy is an elaborate and skillfully developed document defining the long-term and short-term e-business goals of an enterprise.\n",
            "E-business strategy should ideally form part of an enterprise\u2019s business plan, and it should be contained in the organization\u2019s corporate strategy. ",
            "The strategy should interconnect with virtually all strategic plans of the organization including the IT strategic plan, the marketing strategic plan and the organizational strategic plan.\n",
            "The adoption of an e-business strategy is likely to affect the information systems function of a company. ",
            "This impact takes the form of threats as well as benefits. ",
            "Adoption of an e-business strategy is likely to enhance the involvement of the information systems functions in supply distribution. ",
            "It is however important to note that not all middle managers will be eager to accept the adoption of an e-business strategy.\n",
            "Middle managers are likely to oppose the adoption of an e-business strategy the organization brings other middle managers or IT consultants from outside to implement the e-business strategy. ",
            "In this case, middle managers in charge of the information systems function are likely to frustrate the adoption of the e-business strategy because they may feel that the new team is taking over their functions.\n",
            "It is therefore imperative that as an organization adopts an e-business strategy, it ensures that it implements sufficient change management activities to get everybody\u2019s support. ",
            "Otherwise, an organization can fail miserably in its attempt to adopt an e-business strategy.\n"

            "Among the major product lines in the electronic industry are the computers which also form the core products of the electronic companies. ",
            "However, Apple\u2019s computers have lost significant demand due to the limitations the company experiences from complementary products.\n",
            "Hewlett-Packard and Dell have continued to dominate the computer market with their products having a higher demand than other competitors. ",
            "Compared to Apple, firms like Dell and HP are substantially bigger and provide substitute products which attract many consumers due to their compatibility. ",
            "Sony, Samsung and LG have focused more on consumer electronics such as televisions, digital cameras, mobile phones, gaming consoles, DVD players and digital speakers.\n",

            "Since then, Apple store has dominated the personal computer market through innovative products such as the Power Mac and Macintosh, but encountered marketing problems in the 90s. ",
            "Through Steve Jobs, the firm seeded innovative technologies that led to the introduction of new products such as the iPhone, iPad and iTune music store.\n",
            "The company became the new market leader in consumer electronics with the latest success coming from a range of products including the iPod Touch, iTunes, the iPhone, and the iPad (Apple Inc., 2011). ",
            "Presently, the company is the global leader in technology with revenue of $60 billion after overtaking Microsoft in terms of market capitalization in 2010.\n",
            "Sony was founded as a telecommunication engineering company by Akio, Masaru and Tamon in 1946 (Dogruer et al, 2001, p.4). ",
            "The firm immediately adopted transistor technology to produce radios, home video recorders and microphones. ",
            "Due to pressures from competition, Sony diversified beyond consumer electronics and started producing computer chips and computer peripherals. ",
            "Later, the company entered the gaming machines after Nintendo became very successful in the industry.\n",
            "Due to rapid growth through mergers, Sony expanded to other major markets for consumer electronics such as Europe and America. ",
            "So far, the company has focused on consumer electronics and in particular televisions, digital cameras and game machines. ",
            "The company is also a major producer of personal computers and computer microchips.\n",
            "Product overview\n",
            "There are four major product segments that defines Sony\u2019s portfolio. ",
            "They include electronics, games, computers and pictures (Tang, Misra & Shanholt, 2012, pp.16-18). ",
            "The electronic product line consists of products like audio electronics, digital cameras, televisions and speakers.\n",

            "The focus of Sony strategy is to ensure that its products are of high quality and develop profitable and long-term loyalty with customers.\n",
            "The corporate marketing strategy of the firm is to build awareness before launching a product. ",
            "International market success depends on standardization/adaptation to local markets. ",
            "Sonny standardized its products by manufacturing Japanese electronics and adapted local promotions campaigns to build awareness.\n",
            "Apple uses Apple brand as the competitive strength in the highly competitive market such as the PC industry with its Macintosh computers and associated software. ",

            "The branding approach puts emphasis on sentiments such that the brand is about thoughts, routine, novelty, enthusiasm, dreams, autonomy and desires.\n",
            "Macro-environmental analysis\n",
            "Rivalry between competitors\n",
            "While an industry characterized by few large manufacturers and very expensive products hunts a niche audience, the evolution of personal computers has caused an explosion in the industry which currently includes dozens of companies pursuing millions of consumers across the globe.\n",
            "Due to the use of electronic equipments in day to day lives, the equipments are becoming more of commodities (Sony Corporation, 2010). ",
            "For most consumers, economy is more important than performance specifications. ",
            "This has forced many manufacturers to pursue best-cost and low-cost provider strategies.\n",
            "The companies in the middle range compete for consumers by offering various options at varying prices. ",
            "The similarity of electronic products because of industry standard setting leads to competition in prices that squeeze margins and drive prices down. ",
            "Moreover, technological development presents increased competition on the industry.\n",
            "Electronic products are becoming more and more sophisticated, efficient with less energy consumption. ",
            "To hasten the situation, industry leaders like Apple, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have always kept to this pace.\n",
            "Supplier power\n",
            "Suppliers have significant influence over the manufacturers of electronic equipments. ",
            "While many standards in the industry are open and made by collaborative or independent bodies like IEE, manufacturers also depend on standards owned privately. ",
            "Often, the technology requires entrance or must be licensed to a paid-membership group. ",
            "Additionally, the virtual concentration of suppliers puts some pressure on competitors.\n",
            "For personal computers, Sony outsources central processing units from Intel. ",
            "Thus, incompatibility in design does not allow the company to switch to other suppliers. ",
            "However, microchip manufacturers are not present in computer manufacturing business and hence rely on computer manufacturers for their business. ",
            "As a result discounts are placed on exclusivity agreements and bulk purchasing thus lessening some pressure from suppliers.\n",
            "Buyer power\n",
            "As in all businesses, customers have the last say and apply considerable leverage over manufacturers. ",
            "The various buyers with many but differing needs impact manufacturers of electronics directly since they must react and adapt by offering extensive product-lines.\n",
            "The notable characteristic between power user looking for the \u2018greatest and latest\u2019 and average user needing a product which is \u2018just good enough\u2019 presents an obstacle to manufacturers focusing on tapping the many customers possible. ",
            "Manufacturers benefit from the wide use and acceptance of electronic products causing high demand for the products. ",
            "Brand loyalty and proprietary systems are used to maintain customers.\n",
            "Threat of potential entrants\n",
            "Many avenues through which new entrants can enter the electronic market exist; however several hindrances may prevent the entrance. ",
            "The current market is characterized by well entrenched players who have significant brand loyalty and recognition including Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and LG among others (Sony Corporation, 2010).\n",
            "Thus developing a successful brand in the presence of such players is difficult. ",
            "They also keep costs down and dominate with economies of scale that cannot be achieved easily by a new entrant unless a substantial capital is invested. ",
            "Despite these obstacles, new entrants may still come from newly instituted lean organizations which depend on third party OEM (original equipment manufacturers) for production. ",
            "This trend is increasing in popularity bringing companies such as Acer Inc. ",
            "into competition with industry giants.\n",
            "Threat of substitutes\n",
            "The technology sector has substantially grown with the introduction of alternatives such as televisions, game consoles, Smartphone, virtual music stores and personal computers. ",
            "There are now feature-rich smart phones and PDAs in an average living room.\n",
            "Such developments have resulted in consumers focusing their \u201ctechnology money\u201d away from computers, televisions, radios and game consoles. ",
            "However, despite the focus it is not likely that smart phones will diminish the importance of other products significantly. ",
            "The only thing that the substitutes have influenced is elimination of monopoly in the electronic market.\n",
            "Micro-environmental analysis\n",
            "Apple and Sony are leaders in the electronic industry but market their products in the same markets. ",
            "The firms are probably influenced by the same micro-environmental factors. ",
            "They are expected to respond to the dynamics of both individualistic cultures of the west and collective cultures of the east.\n",
            "This is probably achieved by creating organizational cultures that support both team work and individual efforts in the respective areas of operations. ",
            "As the firms become increasingly global, Du Plessis and Beaver (2008) insist on the need to develop an effective International Human Resource Management (IHRM) in order to respond to labor sourcing and expatriation issues.\n",
            "Consumers are also becoming more sensitive to prices and quality hence compelling Apple and Sony to be more responsive through effective quality control systems. ",
            "Involvement in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is also a strategy that Apple and Sony are using to improve their relationship with consumers.\n",

            "Entrepreneurship has taken a new turn with the onset of industrialization and computerization. ",
            "Long before the introduction of these two, entrepreneurship was a less common word that was limited to the business-oriented individuals. ",
            "The introduction of social sites has seen a major breakthrough in the field of entrepreneurship (Abrahamson 1997).\n",
            "Social sites have facilitated easy advertisement and access to millions of prospective customers across the globe. ",
            "One such social site that has contributed to the tremendous growth of entrepreneurship over the last few years is Twitter.\n",
            "This report will look at the advantages and limitations of Twitter as far as its technological configuration of providing an open source arena and limiting messages to one hundred and forty characters is concerned.\n",
            "Countless entrepreneurs have found marketing their products and services via Twitter as a viable means of advertisement. ",
            "Indeed, hundreds of opportunities are advertised daily on twitter for both buyers and sellers.\n",
            "Twitter has enabled entrepreneurs and other business organizations to acquire loyal customers (Amit and Zott 2001). ",
            "In the same manner, buyers have been able to find sellers of their choice through the social site. ",
            "Therefore, twitter has been of great significance to not only the entrepreneurs, but to the buyers as well.\n",
            "The use of Twitter has been favoured by the entrepreneurs for various reasons. ",
            "First and foremost, Twitter\u2019s \u201cRe-tweet\u201d feature helps to spread the information faster as compared to other social networks (Scott 1991). ",
            "This feature enables entrepreneurs to reach millions of prospective clients in a few minutes.\n",
            "This is especially possible where the entrepreneurs have huge numbers of followers (Leinhardt 1977). ",
            "The original tweet by the entrepreneurs can be re-tweeted by their followers and their followers\u2019 followers and the chain continues.\n",
            "Eventually, the original information released by the entrepreneurs will be spread to almost every part of the globe (Baker 1990). ",
            "This fast conveyance of information is a great advantage to the entrepreneurs.\n",
            "Another advantage of twitter is attributed to its cheap cost of advertising compared to other methods of advertisement. ",
            "Because many entrepreneurs advertise their goods and services using Twitter, this has made the cost of advertisement to be lower hence making it more affordable to the entrepreneurs.\n",
            "Twitter is also the cheapest means of advertisement compared to television advertisement and other forms of advertisement. ",
            "This affordability of the costs of advertising on twitter is an advantage to the entrepreneurs who obviously seek a cost effective method of advertisement (Fiskel 1980).\n",
            "Twitter has many users from virtually each nation on earth. ",
            "With an approximate of over three hundred and sixty two million users, Twitter is certainly the best place for entrepreneurs to advertise their products (Tapscott 2000).\n",
            "Entrepreneurs make use of a variety of business models to access this large number of users and turn them into customers (Stokes, Wilson and Mador 2010). ",
            "One such model is the Bricks and Clicks Business Model. ",
            "Under this model, entrepreneurs allow Twitter users to order for products via Twitter.\n",
            "The users however have to go to the entrepreneurs\u2019 stores to pick the ordered products. ",
            "This model is effective especially where the users are located in the entrepreneurs\u2019 locality.\n",
            "The Online Auction Business Model is also extensively used by entrepreneurs on Twitter in their transactions. ",
            "In this model, entrepreneurs advertise a service or product on sale on Twitter and then provide room for Twitter users interested in it to bid.\n",
            "The highest bidder gets the chance to buy the product or service. ",
            "This model is very advantageous to the entrepreneurs because enables them to sell their products and services at the highest price suggested by the buyers (Timmers 1998).\n",
            "As much as Twitter is a suitable social site for the advertisement of products and services by entrepreneurs, it also has some limitations that make it difficult for the entrepreneurs to get the desired effect (Peay 1976). ",
            "One of these challenges is the limited number of characters that entrepreneurs can type in their messages to clients or other entrepreneurs.\n",
            "Twitter only allows users to use a maximum of one hundred and forty characters while writing messages. ",
            "This limitation hinders entrepreneurs from communicating with their clients, prospective customers and other entrepreneurs in an effective manner.\n",
            "As a result, the entrepreneurs may experience delays in response from the recipients of the messages due to difficulty in understanding the message (Mandel 1983). ",
            "If a message is briefly written, there is a high probability of the recipient misunderstanding it.\n",
            "From the foregoing discussion, it is evident that Twitter has played a big role in the spread of entrepreneurship and the facilitation of the activities of entrepreneurs. ",
            "It has done this by easing communication between entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs or customers.\n",
            "It has also provided a cheaper means for entrepreneurs to use for advertising their products and services. ",
            "In addition to that, it is also clear from the foregoing discussion that entrepreneurs access their customers using a variety of business models, some of which have been discussed above.\n",
            "Finally, Twitter has a number of disadvantages that pose a challenge to entrepreneurs using it as a means of communication and advertisement.\n",

            "The Alliance for Childhood is one of the most famous organizations, which aim at promoting children healthy development, their enjoyment of this life, and love to education. ",
            "Nowadays, the vast majority of children cannot imagine their lives without computers: they may communicate being far from each other, play various games, listen to music, find more friends online, and get their education.\n",
            "However, as The Alliance for Childhood states, people\u2019s faith in technology should not be higher than children\u2019s needs. ",
            "The representatives of this organization admit that \u201cthe renewal of education requires personal attention to students from good teachers and active parents, strongly supported by their communication.\u201d ( The Alliance for Childhood )\n",
            "Lots of parents think that the earlier their child will learn how to use computer, the better job will be waiting for him/her in future. ",
            "The Alliance for Childhood cannot agree with such a point, neither do I. ",
            "Parents are afraid that their children may be left behind, this is why they are eager to use all chances, which are presented to them. ",
            "\u201cWiring and computerizing America\u2019s schools is an urgent priority \u2013 not for children, but for high-tech companies that need to constantly expand their markets.\u201d ( The Alliance for Childhood )\n",
            "This is why it is crucially important to pay attention to ethical and social technological implications. ",
            "The Alliance for Childhood focuses on the importance of physical, emotional, and social development of children.\n",
            "Computers pose certain hazards to child\u2019s life, and the mission of parents and teachers is to protect future generation from destructions and health problems, caused by computers. ",
            "Of course, there are certain benefits of computers and the abilities children may get, however, it is necessary to remember about the limits and pay enough attention to active life, healthy food, and real communication \u2013 and all this is impossible to get sitting in front of the computer.\n",
            "Microsoft Word and Writing Poetries\n",
            "The Microsoft Word program turns out to be rather helpful for completing different kinds of assignment. ",
            "Students get much more opportunities to demonstrate their creativeness, present quite interesting ideas in order to explain the topic under consideration, and represent their personal vision of the issue. ",
            "The Microsoft Word program may be also used as a helpful tool to teach students of upper elementary schools on how to write poetry.\n",
            "Without any doubts, students may get lots of benefits using the Microsoft Word program. ",
            "Microsoft Word may correct automatically students\u2019 spelling mistakes and underline the sentences, which may cause some doubts. ",
            "With the help of this program, students can easily find out several synonyms to make the work more sound.\n",
            "It is quite possible to add a captivating picture or any other illustrative material in order to attract reader\u2019s attention. ",
            "However, it is necessary to remember that this program deprive students from the opportunity to correct all the mistakes and train him/herself to pay attention to each detail in the work. ",
            "Students can just rely on the corrections, their computers should make.\n",
            "But still, Microsoft Word cannot be sure about the proper use of this or that word. ",
            "When a student creates poetry, it is necessary to use soul and imagination. ",
            "Of course, this program helps to represent the ideas in the best ways; but the works created by means of some computer programs may be usually deprived of soul and personal emotions, and such deprivation is not inherent to real pieces of art.\n",
            "Poetry is something that should come from the heart; the Microsoft Word program can help to present the ideas in a really attractive way, but still, students should not rely on this program only in order not to forget about emotions, which are not inherent to computers.\n",
            "Presentation for the Parents\u2019 Open House Evening\n",
            "Parents\u2019 open house evenings play a very important role in the life of school and each student. ",
            "Students have a wonderful chance to demonstrate their abilities and underline the issues, which are crucially important for students. ",
            "This is why it is very important to present captivating presentation and use of the reliable material to prove or disprove some fact.\n",
            "Within 15 minutes, it is quite possible to present the topic and explain its strong and weak points. ",
            "However, certain steps have to be taken. ",
            "First, it is necessary to choose the appropriate media for the presentation and for the display. ",
            "Nowadays, a lot of things can be made with the help of computers.\n",
            "If yesterday, people spend much time to paint something or create the necessary exhibits, nowadays, the same people have a good chance to make a presentation within several minutes \u2013 all the necessary example can be created on computers and presented to the smart auditory.\n",
            "Of course, one of the most reliable and frequently used media is CD-R or even CD-RW disks in compatible format. ",
            "It is crucially important to close the session, otherwise, the information on the disk will be impossible to read on the PCs. ",
            "Second, it is better to make several copies of the disk and check whether the information on it is available.\n",
            "To make the presentation really captivating, it is better to use big and not quite bright letters. ",
            "This way, parents will not spend their time and efforts to view the information. ",
            "It is also better not to use too complicated terminology, because not each parent can be aware about it. ",
            "This is why it is better to find the way to speak to the point and use simple language. ",
            "Interesting photos and real life facts \u2013 this is also what can make the presentation better.\n",
            "Computers Are Needed in Classes\n",
            "Without any doubts, the use of computers makes our lives easier. ",
            "Students have a wonderful opportunity to prepare interesting tasks and do not pay much attention to their spelling, as they truly believe that certain computer programs will make all the necessary corrections.\n",
            "Teachers may spend less time to check each work, because computer programs may be rather helpful. ",
            "Is it correct that computers turn out to be so crucially important in our lives? ",
            "There are actually so many doubts according to this very answer. ",
            "But, this time, we have another question to consider: whether computers are so important in schools.\n",
            "In fact, computers in education may be rather helpful. ",
            "The Internet and emails may easily stimulate the student to work \u201cbecause they notice that they have audience.\u201d (Ortega and Bravo, 2000) This is why it is better to use any means to attract student\u2019s attention to study.\n",
            "However, it is also important to analyze what classrooms should be equipped with computers and students of what age should use them. ",
            "To my mind, libraries and labs should have several computers in order to make the work of students easier and provide them with more time for researching. ",
            "With the help of computers, students find the necessary material quicker and can concentrate on the assignment itself.\n",
            "At such classrooms where the lessons on literature, language, and history take place, computers are not necessary. ",
            "However, where certain experiments take place or when students learn to programming or design, the computers should be obviously present.\n",
            "The students of 10-12 years do not pass such classes as programming or science; this is why the students of such age and early may study without computer support. ",
            "As for the other students, to get proper education, they should have an access to computers and be involved into the work.\n",

            "These atoms are neutrons, protons, and electrons. ",
            "Most materials in their elementary form are neutral since the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. ",
            "At the same time, those that are in a compound form are the ones that have a combination of two or more elements.\n",
            "The second property is how different atoms making up the material are arranged in it; since various materials have a different arrangement of atoms. ",
            "Thus, some are more compact than others. ",
            "This is evident in the three states of matter that is: liquid, gas, and solid.\n",
            "The third property is how atoms are bonded within the material itself. ",
            "There are two types of bonding, in particular, covalent and ionic bonding. ",
            "The first type involves sharing of the valence electrons in the material, while ionic bonding is the process where acceptance and donation of valence electrons between the atoms are present (Nils 2010).\n",
            "A semiconductor is a material that is able to exhibit properties of both metals and non-metals such that they act as both insulators and, at the same time, have the ability to conduct electrons. ",
            "The use of silicon based semiconductors revolutionized the field of computing due to their ability to change their level of conductivity by a process known as doping. ",
            "It refers to the addition of impurities in the silicon semiconductor that alters its conductivity.\n",
            "The application of semiconductors led to the invention of different miniature electrical components such as transistors and the integrated circuits. ",
            "These devices possessed the ability to amplify signals, for example, the operational amplifier which is an integrated circuit. ",
            "They also had the ability to switch and convert signals from one form to another.\n",
            "These aforementioned properties of the silicon based semiconductor impacted on the advancement of the computer which became smaller, faster, and more efficient. ",
            "Hence, the computers we use today are very different and far much better than the initial variants. ",
            "The earlier computers used to consume a lot of heat. ",
            "This feature has been rectified with the new generation of computers that consume less power have the ability to cool when heated. ",
            "All these features are possible thanks to the invention of the silicon based semiconductor.\n",

            "Microchips cannot be assembled by humans without the help of machines as they are so small and the soldering of the electrical components requires very specialized machinery (Turley 2002).\n",
            "Microchips are related to integrated circuits in the way that they are just another form of integrated circuits. ",
            "The components in the microchips are a combination of different integrated circuits that have been reduced in size. ",
            "Among these components one could name transistors, operational amplifiers, power regulators, relays, and microcontrollers. ",
            "These devices are combined on a single semiconductor to form a microchip. ",
            "Thus, the basic relation between the microchip and integrated circuits is that the microchip itself contains integrated circuits as its integral components (Cardona 2004).\n",
            "A human brain does not process information on a given time span since the speed of processing varies. ",
            "At the same time, the central processing unit of a computer processes information depending on the computer\u2019s clock speed. ",
            "Hence, computers with a higher clock speed tend to process information faster while computers with a lower clock speed tend to take more time in the processing of data (Winston 2006).\n",
            "One should note that artificial intelligence refers to the ability of computers and machines to reason and make decisions based on their preprogrammed logics. ",
            "This includes robots working in industries or even intelligent cars that can navigate themselves on the road. ",
            "These systems usually require minimal human aid as their level of success is very high and accurately efficient (Nils 2010).\n",
            "Thus, the central processing units make decisions based on preprogrammed logic. ",
            "This means that it cannot make decisions contrary to the programmed logic and hence it lacks the ability to reason rationally. ",
            "On the other hand, human brain makes decisions based on logic as well as the rationale and experience. ",

            "Computers in the Classroom: Pros and Cons Essay (Article)\n",
            "For parents right now, the classroom may already seem fairly alien. ",
            "When an elementary school student shares their frustration with their Prezi presentation about apartheid, or laments the lameness of their PowerPoint animated transitions, parents know that the world has changed.\n",
            "When a high school student makes a video accompanied by music and special effects, demonstrating how Ovid\u2019s word choices reveal character, the change is undeniable. ",
            "However, having computers in the classroom is just the beginning. ",
            "The future school is likely to be almost unrecognizable, in both good ways, and in ways that will need careful management in order to be an unmixed blessing.\n",
            "Computers in the classroom! ",
            "It sounds new. ",
            "It scares some teachers, delights some students, and baffles some parents. ",
            "Bring Your Own Device , as a policy, can be intensely stressful when first implemented. ",
            "It was so scary and anxiety producing this September that it caused a major domestic disturbance in this parent\u2019s household.\n",
            "In fact, however, that particular innovation has been under development since the 1970s. ",
            "One person who undertook to figure out how to help teachers teach and students learn with technology, starting in the mid-70s was Dustin Heuston. ",
            "His ideas seemed \u2018out there\u2019 back in the 70s and 80s, but now seem standard. ",
            "He recognized that just putting a computer in a school would not make kids better learners.\n",
            "To achieve his goal of providing a nearly one-to-one educational experience to each child, the whole approach to presenting information and helping students use it constructively would need adjustment. ",
            "This, in turn, would largely re-define what teaching and learning mean.\n",
            "The equipment that will be available to students may soon be nearly unrecognizable. ",
            "While laptops and tablets are in some classrooms now, in the future, each child could well have a wrist-mounted computer.\n",
            "More conveniently, students might have a computer chip implanted somewhere on their person that could communicate with whatever serves as the equivalent of the internet in their decade. ",
            "In such an environment, teachers will need to figure out how to do more than merely direct students to websites for facts and then ask them to regurgitate them.\n",
            "Teachers will need to be able to teach kids how to think critically and apply the information that is available to them in solving problems. ",
            "With any luck, and the right preparation, the kids of the future will go on to solve world problems such as hunger, environmental degradation, and geopolitical conflict.\n",
            "One immediate challenge, and one that teachers (and some committed, serious students) are trying to resolve right now, is the problem of distraction. ",
            "For the teacher, having kids involved in multiple social interactions online while sitting at their seats may seem like a class control nightmare. ",
            "For many students, the activities of their classmates may prove fatal to their focus on the task at hand and on the instructor.\n",
            "There are, indeed, tools available at present, such as Insight by Faronics, to control and manage the problem of kids visiting websites off-topic, playing games, Facebooking, or simply continuing legitimate work but doing so when the teacher has called for attention. ",
            "They are even beginning to seem less creepy and intrusive. ",
            "Thank goodness, because in the future, the teacher may confront student web activity that may be nearly invisible to the eye.\n",
            "The solution of some teachers at the moment, for example, some faculty at the Science Leadership Academy in Philadelphia, is to permit most online activity, but to offer no leniency if the student has missed a key instruction, or course content, and fails an assessment. ",
            "Thus, in the words of one teacher, there may be a great deal of what looks like goofing off during class, but one can distinguish the kids who are fooling around on their devices too much by their grades.\n",
            "The advantages may outweigh such problems. ",
            "Imagine being able to teach several classrooms at once, in widely dispersed regions of the world. ",
            "This is already happening to some extent via MOOC courses such as Coursera.\n",
            "A webcam, a decent microphone system, and a solid internet connection are all that are needed to reach literally tens of thousands of students globally. ",
            "At least one instructor, Al Filreis, at the University of Pennsylvania, reports that it was \u201ca blast\u201d. ",
            "Of course, in the case of Coursera, there are plenty of teaching assistants and a good bit of peer reviewing by other students to help with the volume of work.\n",
            "This model for making quality instruction available to the entire world is likely to expand, and the potential impact is hard to fathom. ",
            "The limitations of affordability, cultural prohibitions (for example, against women in the classroom), and geography, will become simply irrelevant.\n",
            "Imagine students being able to do collaborate in real time, with no barriers of messaging or signal loss. ",
            "This is happening to some extent now using Skype or Facebook or one of the Google tools. ",
            "However, there are sometimes delays in these otherwise rich media channels, due either to dropped signals, or slow internet connections.\n",
            "A future of untrammeled, nearly effortless, and reliable communication will be accompanied by other challenges. ",
            "How can teachers design assignments and assessments to require rather than punish the inevitable cooperation that will occur? ",
            "This is going to require imagination and creativity, but good teachers are endowed with these anyway.\n",
            "Many classrooms are already filled with equipment and software that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years back. ",
            "Many students have access to a breadth of information that seems to rival Dr. ",
            "Who. ",
            "With any luck, these kids will go on to use all these resources to solve tough global problems like hunger, environmental degradation, and conflict.\n"

            "Modeling, Prototyping and CASE Tools: The Inventions to Support the Computer Engineering Essay\n",
            "Despite the fact that the engineering is constantly being enriched with the new notions and techniques which add the new ways and methods to make the process of engineering quicker and flawless, the science still has its basics, which are modeling, prototyping and CASE tools. ",
            "Whenever there is a computer problem to solve, there is always the necessity to take the abovementioned notions into account. ",
            "The quality of the program working depends on these issues to the highest degree.\n",
            "Now I would like to give definition for these notions.\n",
            "Modeling includes creating the scheme, the outline for the future project. ",
            "It enables the engineer to help to see the problem at once and to understand the ways to solve the puzzle. ",
            "As Shelly points it out, there are three kinds of modeling that can improve the process:\n",
            "The system analysis phase includes four main activities: requirements modeling, data and process modeling, object modeling and consideration of development strategies. ",
            "(138)\n",
            "As it can be seen, modeling is basically creating a platform which will hold the program atop.\n",
            "The next element, prototyping, means that a certain piece of work is produced quickly as a draft: \u201cprototyping produces an early, rapidly constructed working version of the proposed information system called a prototype\u201d (Shelly 314).\n",
            "However, the prototype version can have certain mixed effects on the system operation:\n",
            "Some found prototyping to be positively related to higher system performance, but others found that prototyping might create less robust, less functional systems, with potentially less coherent designs. ",
            "(Chiang 51)\n",
            "Thus, it is clear that the idea of prototyping concerns a draft of the future program that highlights all the details of the program yet represents just an outline, not being a complete work yet.\n",
            "The last issue of the computer engineering processes to speak about is the one called CASE tools. ",
            "Following the deciphering that Lyytinen provides (1), CASE is computer aided software engineering. ",
            "Thus, the basics of their work can be defined in the following way:\n",
            "The field of CASE is, in principle, very broad and ranges from simple tools such as linkers, loaders or compilers up to complicated integrated environments. ",
            "In more recent thinking, however, CASE has been largely adopted to denote a more narrow range of technologies. ",
            "(1)\n",
            "Combined together, the three issues of computer engineering can actually work. ",
            "These are the ground for the computer programs to be created. ",
            "Taking into consideration that these stages include the use of the tools that are constantly developing, the computer engineering keeps going on without stopping, which makes it one of the lead sciences in the 21 st century.\n",
            "The stages described above make the initial draft for the future computer program to stem from and remain the cornerstone for programming processes.\n",

            "Experts Respond To Questions Better Than Computers Essay\n",
            "It is important to think about effects of computers on roles played by experts in responding to queries on various fields of study. ",
            "Robots might replace human beings in future because of advancements in technology. ",
            "Critics argue that computers are more effective, fast, and thorough in providing information on certain areas of study. ",
            "However, experts give better responses because they possess ability to synthesize, evaluate, and criticize information in order to provide best answers to queries.\n",
            "First, skills of an expert are needed to feed a computer with information that it generates when presented with a query. ",
            "Therefore, an expert gives better responses to queries than a computer. ",
            "Information obtained from computers is secondhand because it originates from experts (Baldauf and Stair 34).\n",
            "However, critics argue that computers give better responses because humans are prone to errors. ",
            "This argument is erroneous because even computers make errors depending on quality of programs installed. ",
            "Moreover, an expert can correct errors but a computer cannot.\n",
            "Second, robots only respond to queries that contain certain search phrases. ",
            "A robot cannot give responses to unclear queries if a certain phrase is not provided (Helander and Prabhu 42). ",
            "In contrast, experts understand queries better than robots and offer the best answers after evaluating and analyzing information (Baldauf and Stair 37). ",
            "A Computer may give a wrong response because a search phrase might be connected to a different answer in the computer\u2019s program.\n",
            "Critics argue that even experts occasionally fail to understand queries and thus give wrong answers. ",
            "However, interaction between people facilitates better understanding because more information that improves comprehension can be provided (Helander and Prabhu 44). ",
            "A computer cannot respond to additional information because it responds only to certain phrases. ",
            "If the scope of a phrase is not inclusive of all aspects of the query, then a robot provides an insufficient answer.\n",
            "Third, responses from computers are limited in scope because there is no interpersonal discourse between a user and the computer (Markoff 73). ",
            "In contrast, a human expert can provide additional information on a certain query by interacting with the other person. ",
            "An expert evaluates a query from different perspectives and as such, gives the most appropriate answer.\n",
            "If computers give better responses to queries than humans do, they would be used to instruct students in institutions of learning. ",
            "However, they are not used because they have several limitations such as inability to interact with students. ",
            "Some critics argue that computers are not used because policies to allow there are nonexistent. ",
            "However, there is no evidence of computer use in teaching except video conferencing between learners and instructors.\n",
            "Computers cannot instruct learners because of two main reasons. ",
            "First, they lack ability to learn and their functioning depends on humans. ",
            "Second, they lack creativity and respond to queries based on their programming (Markoff 75). ",
            "If used for instruction, they cannot answer questions from learners due to inability to interact with students. ",
            "Therefore, humans are better at responding to queries than robots.\n",
            "In conclusion, human experts are better at responding to queries compared to robots. ",
            "Robots provide responses based on their programming that may be limited. ",
            "Therefore, they depend on human intelligence and secondhand information. ",
            "In contrast, humans provide responses after careful evaluation and analysis of information, functions that robots cannot perform. ",

            "Principal arguments for and against capital leases\n",
            "The current case study entails leasing computers at Persistent Learning, an educational software company. ",
            "Leasing Computers is in the midst of making a financial decision on the most appropriate way of acquiring assets (computers and related hardware) for purposes of expansion. ",
            "Owing to its financial position, the company has two options of financing its expansion objective. ",
            "The options are to undertake a \u201cfair-market-value\u201d lease and the \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d.\n",
            "Under the fair-market-value\u201d lease the company would be under rental agreement while under the \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d the company would provide financing for the computers purchase. ",
            "This case study analysis is an attempt to answer different questions relating to the \u201cfair -market-value\u201d less and \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d less options. ",
            "In addition, it provides the most effective and appropriate choice between the two leasing options.\n",
            "Based on the case study, Persistent Learning competitors own their computers which give them a competitive advantage over rivals. ",
            "Competitors own their computers because they have a higher cash-flow compared to Persistent Learning. ",
            "In addition the companies have an outstanding capital base that enables them to purchase computers. ",
            "Companies with their own competitors treat the computers as fixed assets which is a long term investment in an organization.\n",
            "Also, the companies with computers are flexible as they do not have to negotiate with third party capital equipment providers. ",
            "This saves time and a lot of paperwork often incurred during a leasing process. ",
            "By owning capital equipment such as computers, such an ownership enables the companies to enjoy economic life of the capital. ",
            "Furthermore, the companies can easily sell old computers or upgrade them at a much cheap prices.\n",
            "Accounting for \u201cfair-market-value\u201d and \u201cone-dollar-purchase\u201d\n",
            "Within a period of three years, fair market value lease would be accounted for as an operating expense or lease payments as opposed to an asset to Persistent learning. ",
            "On the other hand, one dollar purchase would be accounted for as an asset since the company would get to own the computers after a period of three years.\n",
            "Under the fair market value the equipments are accounted for as operating expenses because the company would be paying for the equipments for which they lack ownership obligations. ",
            "The fair market value as a leasing expense is accounted for on the company\u2019s income statement.\n",
            "One dollar purchase would be accounted for as both a liability and an asset and recorded on the balance sheet. ",
            "It is accounted for as an asset as it reflects the equipments\u2019 value to the organizations. ",
            "On the other hand, it is accounted for as a liability because Persistent Learning has an obligation to pay the lease expenses to the lesser.\n",
            "As an asset, the equipment acquired through the one dollar purchase would depreciate during the three year period. ",
            "As a result, it would be accounted for as a depreciation expense in both cash flow and income statements. ",
            "Since Persistent Learning does not own the equipment, there is no depreciation expenses realized under the fair market value. ",
            "In addition, no liability is accorded to the leasing company thus it cannot be accounted as a liability.\n",
            "Classification of leases\n",
            "Fair market value lease would be classified as an operating lease while the one dollar purchase would be classified as capital lease since under the fair market lease, capital equipment is only leased for the operating period. ",
            "On the other hand, the one dollar purchase ensures ownership of the property or capital equipment after the agreed lease period. ",
            "Therefore, under the former a firm does not own the equipment while at the later the equipment is treated as owned.\n",
            "It is important to note that both capital and operating leases either have no effects or different effects on income statement, cash flow statement, or the balance sheet. ",
            "Although an operating lease may not have an effect on the balance sheet, it tends to affect the income statement.\n",
            "On the other hand, capital lease has an effect on the balance sheet and income statement. ",
            "For instance, depreciation of funds under the capital lease lowers their value on the balance sheet, while at the same time recording a depreciation of expenses, which is seen in the income statement.\n",
            "Operating lease is reflected on the income statement as expenses incurred during the accounting period. ",
            "Therefore, operating expenses act as lease payment which is an expense that reduces net income. ",
            "Total cash flow statements are not affected by capital and operating leases since the actual cash flow remains constant even if a lease is accounted for as an operating lease of a capital lease.\n",
            "With regard to income statement, cash flow under the income statement tends to be comparatively higher in comparison with cash flow under an operating lease. ",
            "The reason behind this is that under capital lease, a lease is treated as an asset which depreciates as cash flow inclines during the lease period.\n",
            "Appropriate lease alternative for Persistent Learning\n",
            "The best leasing alternative for Persistent Learning based on the case study is the \u201cFair-market-value\u201d lease. ",
            "In this alternative, the company would engage in a rental agreement. ",
            "It is the cheapest option under the circumstances and the most appropriate type of lease as it is flexible and Persistent Learning can still purchase the equipment after a period of three years at the prevailing market fair value.\n",
            "The company is certain that the capital equipment would be needed for a period of three years. ",
            "Because of market uncertainty and obsolescence of equipments, Persistent Learning would choose the \u201cFair-market-value\u201d lease. ",
            "In addition, the company would not require the computers after three years. ",
            "So there is no need to own computers at the end of three years and sell them at lower prices. ",
            "Having to dispose or sell the computers is a time consuming process which is also costly.\n",
            "Based on the case study, the company plans to use the computers in three years and the economic life of the computers is 5 years. ",
            "Therefore, the lease period is defined to be less than 75% of the capital equipment\u2019s expected economic life which makes Persistent Learning qualify for fair market value lease.\n",
            "On the other hand, the present value for the lease payments is less than 90 percent of the equipment. ",
            "Persistent Learning would have to pay for the equipment usage for three years and supposing that it still needs the equipment for another year, the company has the choice to renew the lease.\n",
            "Alternatively, Persistent Learning can choose to purchase the computers at the fair market value. ",
            "In this kind of purchase, Persistent Learning would buy the computers after calculating the equipments depreciation in a period of three years. ",
            "Lastly, the monthly lease rates are lower in fair market value lease compared to the one dollar purchase. ",
            "Therefore, I would prefer the fair market value lease to the one dollar purchase.\n",
            "Principal arguments for and against capital leases\n",
            "Initially, capital and operating leases were recorded differently but the reevaluation by the FASB would now ensure that all leases are treated as capital leases. ",
            "In other words, all leases would be recorded as liabilities and assets. ",
            "Capital leases have the capacity to recognize expenses (liabilities and depreciation expenses) compared to operating leases. ",
            "As a result, leases would be recognized as liability and as an asset when accounted for in a balance sheet.\n",
            "Consequently, firms (lessee) would be in a position to claim for depreciation of the leased capital equipment annually. ",
            "In addition, the lessee would be allowed to deduct the interest expense in each financial year. ",
            "Operational leases are not shown on a firm\u2019s balance sheet like it is the case for capital leases. ",
            "Therefore, treating all leases as capital leases would ensure that leases are recorded on the balance sheet thus showing the financial position of a firm to creditors.\n",
            "One of the major arguments against this move is that debt level reported would increase. ",
            "This is because classification of operating leases as capital leases would require the levels of reported debts to be exposed to financiers which have effect on individual credibility. ",
            "In addition, this would have an impact on debt covenant compliance. ",
            "Another argument against the change is an anticipated increase in lease expenses.\n",
            "Under operating leases, the lease expenses remained constant for the agreed period. ",
            "However, treating leases as capital leases would increase lease costs. ",
            "By reclassifying the leases, the level of debt indicated in the balance sheet would be increased by firms operating large operating leases. ",
            "This may have negative effect on the financial position of an organization. ",
            "Lastly, the commitments by lessee to not assume ownership of capital equipment after the lapse of lease period should not be treated as a debt but rather as a rational choice.\n"

            "Video and computer games emerged around the same time as role playing games during the 1970s, and there has always been a certain overlap between video and computer games and larger fantasy and sci-fi communities (King and Borland 2003). ",
            "Many early games were solitary endeavors, but the past decade has witnessed a massive explosion in the popularity of networked games, with titles such as Doom and Quakes standing out as early exemplars.\n",
            "In the mid 1990s, online video and computer games (OVCGs), which could be played through servers that connect hundreds of thousands of computers together, began to appear across the US, Europe and Asia.\n",
            "Online video and computer games (OVCGs) do not require that players be physically co-present; rather, players gather in virtual game worlds where they play avatars- computer-mediated fantasy characters. ",
            "For online video and computer games (OVCGs) to function it needs a computer as well as the software, instead of other tools used by several other games.\n",
            "In addition, many online games, such as EverQuest (Sony) and World of Warcraft (Blizzard), have a monthly subscription fee. ",
            "Similar to Role-playing games (RPGs) and collectible Strategy Games (CSGs), but different from many non-networked video and computer games, Online video and computer games (OVCGs) are specifically designed to offer hundreds of hours of highly interactive gameplay and for the development of characters\u2019 identities (Schubert 333).\n",
            "Online video and computer games have settings and systems, just like Role-playing games (RPGs), but the computer controls both, which simplifies the games in some important ways.\n",
            "Online video and computer games involve multiplayer game worlds and allow for instant peer-to-peer communication, either through typed conversation or through voice-over chat. ",
            "As players cooperate with one another on multiple occasions and for multiple purposes, they develop the same sense of shared community, and become known to one another through their specific style of play and their characters\u2019 names.\n",
            "Perhaps the biggest draw of on-line gaming, however, is the visual effects, which can be highly detailed with a sense of three dimensional spaces. ",
            "The ability to play at any time one desires, for as long or as short a time as desired, is also an advantage since a player can find others online at any hour of the day or night.\n",
            "Many online games today allow for a high degree of character customization and allow various paths towards success, so it is possible to create an interesting, original character that is not only present in one\u2019s head, or on a piece of paper, but which is walking, jumping, fighting, or flying on the screen in front of the player. ",
            "As Online video and computer games become more akin to \u201cmovies that I can control\u201d their attractiveness increases.\n",
            "Unfortunately, OVCGs requires a substantial monetary investment and a degree of technical proficiency. ",
            "Additionally, Online video and computer games are still less portable RPGs and CSGs. ",
            "Despite these problems, Online video and computer games are the fastest growing segment of the fantasy game industry and have gained more widespread acceptability than either table top RPGs or CSGs (Schubert 338)\n",
            "To continue our fictional example of Academia: The Overeducated, the online version immerses players in a virtual university and the opening shot on the computer screen is that of the Registrar\u2019s office. ",
            "There, the player selects his/her character\u2019s name, age, sex, height, weight, race, and other physical characteristics, and also signs up for first-year classes.\n",
            "This would generate a graphical representation of the player\u2019s character that one could then watch, control, and manipulate through virtual world. ",
            "The character would be given a campus map and directions to a dorm room, as well as a key to the room. ",
            "From that point on, the player would navigate through the halls of the Administration Building, on his or her way to the dorm, realizing that every person walking through the hall is also a player; a real person, somewhere in the world, sitting in front of a computer.\n",
            "The player could have the character to stop and ask people about classes, inquire if a teacher was strict with attendance or not, and learn about useful bits of information that would help the character succeed in whatever tasks were encountered during game play.\n",
            "Many role playing and collectible strategy gamers are also computer gamers, and those that are not are typically at least familiar with inline computer gaming and likely know some of the more popular game titles.\n",
            "In the gaming industry, several of the larger RPG and CSG publishers have produced computer games based on their projects, or else have licensed their products to computer game manufacturers. ",
            "While each type of game has its distinct advantages and disadvantages, an increasingly internet connected world and today\u2019s fast paced life make Online video and computer games very attractive to gamers generally.\n",

            "Social Implications of Computer Technology: Cybercrimes Essay\n",
            "Cybercrime, returning to a definition provided by Toby Finnie, Tom Petee, and John Jarvis, refers to any crime that involves a computer and a network, where a computer may or may not have played an instrumental part in the commission of crime (7).\n",
            "The term cyber crime or cyber related crime would be used to refer to criminal act like that of identity theft, fraud, security breach, child pornography (Finnie, Petee, and Jarvis 7). ",
            "Many of the techniques involve the use of a computer or a network, but many more techniques have nothing to do with computers other than information stored in text files on a computer\u2019s hard drive.\n",
            "To address cyber crime and cyber related crimes further, a distinction is made between computers as targets of crime and computer-facilitated crime.\n",
            "While the former refers to crimes targeting computers or other electronic channels as such and include acts like unauthorized entry into computer systems, vandalism, virus attacks, or warfare offensives, so called computer-facilitated crimes are in fact \u201ctraditional crimes that can be or have been committed by using other means of perpetration which are now carried out through an Internet based computer-related venue (e.g. ",
            "email, newsgroups, other networks) or other technological computing advancement\u201d; or, to put in other words, crimes that use the computer as a medium to commit crimes (Finnie, Petee, and Jarvis 8).\n",
            "Computer-facilitated crimes can be more systematically classified under three main traditional categories of crime: against persons, against property, and against public order and public interest.\n",
            "In reading the discussion above it becomes clear that the term cybercrime actually refers to computer-related crime; however, some consider computer crime to be a subdivision of cybercrime that warrants its own definition and understanding.\n",
            "The term \u2018cyberspace\u2019 became popular descriptor of the mentally constructed virtual environment within which networked computer activity takes place. ",
            "\u2018Cybercrime\u2019 broadly describes the crimes that take place within that space and the term has come to symbolize insecurity and risk online.\n",
            "By itself, cybercrime is fairly meaningless because it tends to be used metaphorically and emotively rather than scientifically or legally, usually to signify the occurrence of harmful behavior that is somehow related to the misuse of a networked computer system (Finnie, Petee, and Jarvis 10).\n",
            "Largely an invention of the media, \u2018cybercrime\u2019 originally had no specific reference point in law and the offending that did become associated with the term was a rather narrow legal construction based upon concerns about hacking. ",
            "In fact, many of the so-called cybercrimes that have caused concern over the past decade are not ethically crimes in criminal law.\n",
            "However, regardless of its merits and demerits, the term \u2018cybercrime\u2019 has entered the public parlance and we are stuck with it. ",
            "It is argued that the term has a greater meaning if we construct it in terms of the transformation of criminal or harmful behavior by networked technology, rather than simply the behavior itself.\n",
            "This is an interesting happenstance within the context of transformation thesis, because although the contemporary meaning of \u2018cyber\u2019 is firmly linked to technological innovation, its origins lie in the Greek Kubernetes, which is also the root of the word \u2018govern\u2019.\n",
            "More by happenstance than plan, the word cyber and crime interrelates linguistically. ",
            "This linkage becomes more significant if we understand cybercrimes as the crimes which are mediated (governed) by networked technology and not just computer.\n",

            "Through a Computer Display and What People See There: Communication Technologies and the Quality of Social Interactions Opinion Essay\n",
            "Introduction: Communication Technologies Come to the Rescue\n",
            "It is hard to deny that communication technologies play a great role in the lives of billions of people all over the world. ",
            "With the rise of technology and the surge of innovations that have opened new possibilities for communication between the people in different parts of the world, ordinary live conversation seems to have faded into the background, making more room for new means of communication.\n",
            "Because of the current fascination with technological advances and the active use of the latter, people are rapidly losing the skills of live communication, which is likely to lead to a number of difficulties in socializing, both concerning people\u2019s personal life and business affairs.\n",
            "Reaching for the Most Remote Corners of the World: The Positive Aspects\n",
            "One of the most obvious advantages of communication technologies is the fact that with the help of the latter, one can keep in touch with the people who live miles away, which would be completely impossible without the recent innovations.\n",
            "Therefore, it can be concluded that with the help of the current developments, the distance between the subjects of communication is no longer a problem, not to mention the fact that new forms of media have offered the methods for distanced learning (Atkin 71). ",
            "However, there are still a lot of issues about communication technologies that need to be revisited.\n",
            "Getting Lost in the Virtual Reality: Where Technologies Fail\n",
            "Losing touch with the real world is the hazard that everyone has talked about; ironically enough, even the new forms of media that the given problem concerns have been used to discuss it. ",
            "Indeed, with the growing impact of social network, people seem to be losing the skills of live communication, which is likely to lead to considerable problems in future. ",
            "Moreover, frequent use of technology as a communication tool can lead to negative social effects, such as the need to stay anonymous (Levi 262).\n",
            "Hence, the threat of deindividualization becomes much more tangible: \u201cThe members of virtual groups are more anonymous. ",
            "This leads to what psychologists call deindividualization, which is the loss of self-awareness and evaluation apprehension caused by feeling anonymous\u201d (Levi 262). ",
            "It is worth mentioning, though, that the latter concerns rather online chatting than the use of mobile phone or social networking.\n",
            "Humans vs. ",
            "Machines: Concerning the Probable Prospects\n",
            "Hence, it seems that technologies will definitely be of great help in providing high-quality means of keeping in touch. ",
            "However, it still must be admitted that technologies will never be able to replace personal contact, while they should not.\n",
            "According to Partee, live communication is essential for people: \u201cWe humans need personal contact to communicate values\u201d (Partee ix). ",
            "It is clear that once the current communication technology takes over the world, the tradition of personal conversation will disintegrate into a mess, since people will most likely lose the necessary skills required for a live conversation.\n",
            "Another Means to Raise the Stakes: Technologies Have a Chance\n",
            "One must give credit to the developers of the modern communication technologies, though; it is clear that, when used reasonably, these technological advances can help greatly. ",
            "Therefore, it can be assumed that, when used with due care, communication technology will not make people less sociable, but will help them keep in touch despite the distances between them (Shih and Hung, 67).\n",
            "About Use and Abuse: A Reasonable Solution to the Problem\n",
            "To balance out the use of live and virtual communication, it is necessary to realize what the current technological advances offer (Konijn, Utz, Tanis and Barnes 19).\n",
            "Therefore, it is necessary to consider such innovations as mobile phones, smartphones, computers, etc. ",
            "not a substitute for live communication, but an additional opportunity to get in touch with the one who is currently not available in person. ",
            "With such an approach, it can be expected that technological advances will be used as a complementary communicational tool, and not as the only possible one.\n",
            "Conclusion: Looking for a Compromise\n",
            "It is hard to ignore the fact that communication technology in many aspects is very helpful, since it provides chances for people to arrange something concerning not only their personal life, but also their business issues, which means that communication technology development boosts business processes.\n",
            "With all due respect for the engineers who have provided the humankind with the existing technologies for even more efficient communication, one still has to admit that in many ways, the given technologies kill the tradition of live conversation slowly, but steadily.\n",
            "Since technologies have become so fully integrated into people\u2019s lives that rejecting thee technologies means losing a huge chunk of their lives, at the given stage, a compromise between virtual and live communication must be provided. ",
            "Therefore, technologies must be used only when the alternative method of communication is not available.\n",

            "Research Paper\n",
            "With the increasing popularity of computers, more college instructors have converted from paper-and-pencil to computer-based tests for benefits such as reduced grading effort and the ability to test more frequently (Etrurk, et al. ",
            "2004). ",
            "Computer based assessment has increased in the recent times. ",
            "Different organizations are using it for different purposes.\n",
            "According to Etrurk and others (2004), several organizations are currently using computer based assessment for drivers\u2019 license exams, job interviews, certification of exams and entrance exams for post-secondary education. ",
            "It has been argued that the mode of testing administration affect scores (Clariana & Wallace, 2002). ",
            "So far, there is evidence that identical paper-based and computer based tests cannot obtain same results. ",
            "However, study results have been inconsistent (Kingston, 2009,).\n",
            "Even when Computer-based and paper-based testing with have identical items, they may not produce equivalent measures of student learning. ",
            "Some research also found that the format of the exam and the subject being tested on also matters. ",
            "In this essay, I will analyze the current body of research and attempt to determine whether administration via computer yields equivalent scores as paper-and-pencil administration, and further explore the validity of computer-based testing.\n",
            "Most of the studies so far conducted shows that computer-based tests are more superior to paper-based test. ",
            "Some instructional quota insists that the two tests methods should give same scores. ",
            "Practically these methods do not give same scores (Mason et al. ",
            "2001). ",
            "Other studies have concluded that computer-based and paper-based tests are nearly identical (Erturk et al. ",
            "2004).\n",
            "There are several variations of Computer-based and paper-based testing. ",
            "Some of these differences highlight advantages of one over the other method. ",
            "In a synthesis of 81 recent studies, Kingston (2009) concludes that the mode of administration does not affect student achievement across a grade level.\n",
            "However, recent studies by Butters and Walstad (2011) in which multiple-choices answers were used for testing shows that students who completed the test on computers outperformed a paper-based test group and that computer-based testing has the potential to reduce item guessing.\n",
            "Variations of score have been caused by some discrepancies. ",
            "Researchers who support the test mode effect argue that previous experiments which showed no differences in achievement and arrived at a different result did so due to differences in distribution of assessment and sample size (Maguire et al. ",
            "(2010).\n",
            "Wide range of students gives consistence results than skewed population. ",
            "They further found out that most students were more comfortable interfacing with computers than using a pencil and pen during their tests; this mitigate students\u2019 test anxiety. ",
            "Clariana and Wallace (2002) found out that scores variations were caused by settings of the system in computer-based and level of strictness of examiners in paper-based.\n",
            "The difference in computer-based and paper-based tests can be affected by learner\u2019s characteristics. ",
            "Learners with poor knowledge of computers are likely to fail an online exam. ",
            "On the other hand, computer literate student with higher academic attainment taking an online exam is likely to do well (Clariana and Wallace, 2002).\n",
            "Clariana and Wallace (2002) further examined previous studies which showed that computer based tests on verbal quantitative and analytic sections of all tests were all greater than complementary paper-based test scores. ",
            "They also found out that computer familiarity is the most fundamental factor in test mode effect for unfamiliar content and low attaining examinees.\n",
            "They also found out that computer familiarity is the most fundamental factor in test mode effect for unfamiliar content or for low attaining examinees. ",
            "This is mainly for students with limited access to computer. ",
            "Higher attaining students will easily adapt to any assessment method and develop test-taking strategies for any new approach. ",
            "Computer familiarity should become a less factor when all students have become computer literate (Butters et al. ",
            "2004).\n",
            "Although some differences are common, testing methods sometimes have multiple choice questions. ",
            "Together with multiple choices testing, subjects should be put into consideration before a method is used. ",
            "Kingston (2009) concludes that English, arts and social sciences had an advantage on computer-based test.\n",
            "On the other hand, Mathematics and science test favored paper-based test (Kingston, 2009). ",
            "I have been exposed to computers all my life and been using internet for over ten years. ",
            "This makes me feel more comfortable in computerized testing environment. ",
            "I have learned that writing through a computer give better results.\n",
            "There are several befits associated with computer based testing. ",
            "This test method saves time for students under it. ",
            "Choices are mostly made by a simple click of a mouse rather than writing. ",
            "This makes it easy and fast for students who are familiar with computers and high attaining. ",
            "Furthermore, examinees do not have to go to examination centers, instead they just can have an internet connection (Noyes and Garlandb 2008).\n",
            "Another benefit of computer-based test is immediate scoring and reporting of results. ",
            "The test can be easily monitored since the system records start and end time, amount of time spent on a particular item and integrated survey responses. ",
            "Tests are recorded and scored electronically with minimum challenges. ",
            "Results of tests can be accessed by third parties easily in spreadsheets, word and other application packages. ",
            "The massive data generated makes analysis, access, retrieval and reporting of results easy (Meissner, 2007).\n",
            "Flexible test scheduling is one benefit of computer-based tests (Meissner, 2007). ",
            "There is availability of single-day tests administration window to continuous ones. ",
            "An approach chosen by a student is based on his or her access, publishing frequency and exposure.\n",
            "Exam administrators have an opportunity to ensure test security, standard setting and forms assembly. ",
            "Candidates are flexible to take exam at their convenience since it is offered all year round. ",
            "After administrators create an exam, it becomes hard for content to be jeopardized or items to be compromised.\n",
            "Item statistics available for tests sponsor are monitored as they are generated. ",
            "The flexibility of technology provides the testing program with experience by virtue of unique testing experience from various candidates. ",
            "Various forms of test navigations are used (Noyes and Garlandb 2008)\n",
            "Instructors and administrators have an opportunity to include innovative item formats that are made possible by use of technology. ",
            "Computer-based tests engage navigation and presentation of items in several ways. ",
            "Test authors can pre-define sequence of sections or test-lets through linear by considering performance of previous tests. ",
            "This testing system affords several unique content presentation styles. ",
            "Various elements of tests may be presented on one page per item or clustered together according to the preferred method.\n",
            "There are reduced costs of test production, administration and scoring. ",
            "Tests are not published as hard copies before they are done by candidates. ",
            "During tests, no invigilators are required to supervise candidates. ",
            "Finally, no teachers are required to mark tests before results are released. ",
            "This reduces the cost of preparing, administering and processing of results.\n",
            "According to Meissner (2007), use of computer based tests enhances security of the tests and results. ",
            "The system reduces cumulative impact of item exposure on subsequent administrators. ",
            "Although the scheduling is flexible, items are exposed and security of tests jeopardized.\n",
            "This situation can be mitigated by having by several forms at a time. ",
            "It can also be dealt with by having a smaller number of forms but refreshed them frequently. ",
            "Security can be enhanced by encrypting the processed data before transmission. ",
            "To access the data, owners can be subjected to authentication procedure which may include figure prints and digital photograph.\n",
            "Computer-based tests are consistent and reliable as compared to paper-based tests. ",
            "Computer-based testing applies high degree of standardization. ",
            "Policies and procedures are easily adhered to. ",
            "These structures ensure consistency and reliability of the system. ",
            "This can be seen in timing which is strictly and rigidly controlled. ",
            "Furthermore, referencing materials can be incorporated as attachments (Meissner, 2007).\n",
            "Apart from the several benefits highlighted above, computer-based test has a number of detrimental to students. ",
            "When computer-based test is made mandatory for all students, those with poor computer skills are affected negatively. ",
            "They end up scoring lower than what they would have passed had paper-based test been used (Russell et al. ",
            "2003).\n",
            "Computer-based test does not provide examinees with the opportunity to revise their work after marking. ",
            "This affects students\u2019 future performance negatively. ",
            "On the other hand, Vispoel et al. ",
            "(1992) concluded that such tests do not always yield equivalent results. ",
            "They added that the tests should be equated to ensure use of fair test scores. ",
            "The amount of control in computer-based tests does not allow review of items by examinee.\n",
            "Computer based tests do not allow examinee to change their answers as they would have done in a paper-based test (Russell et al. ",
            "2003). ",
            "Previous research has shown that most answers change by student become correct. ",
            "Therefore, failure by students to change answers when they think they have entered a wrong one, effects negatively on their performance during computer-based test (Russell et al. ",
            "2003).\n",
            "According to Russell et al. ",
            "(2003), item layout and presentation have some effects on examinee. ",
            "Tests requiring multi-screens, graphical or complex display have negative effects on examinee performance. ",
            "Sometimes graphical display issues may be detrimental to performance of examinee. ",
            "Such issues include screen size, font size and resolutions of graphics of some items. ",
            "Such situation affects performance of examinee negatively (Russell et al. ",

            "Malfunctioning of computer software or hardware during a test can be detrimental to examinee. ",
            "When a computer part is changed or computer system is restarted, a student is forced to restart again leading to double submission (Noyes & Garlandb, 2008).\n",
            "There are ethical issues concerning computer-based tests. ",
            "Confidentiality of examinee\u2019s work is not guaranteed in online examination. ",
            "Respondents also tend to create a particular impression of their results (Noyes & Garlandb, 2008).\n",
            "To conclude, benefits of computer based exams outweigh its detrimental. ",
            "Benefits are on both sides of the exams. ",
            "Students or examiners have their benefits, for instance, score and flexibility of exams. ",
            "Sponsors spend less money to offer such tests because there is no supervision, printing and physical marking. ",
            "Administrators too have their work simplified as the system requires little supervision.\n",
            "Detrimental of this testing system are few. ",
            "However, almost all are on the examinees\u2019 side. ",
            "As time goes by, more people become computer literate and access computers, most of the tests would be conducted on computer in most places. ",
            "Negative effects will be less because majority of examinees would be computer literate.\n",
            "To ensure that it does not disadvantage certain student, computer-based testing needs close cooperation between exam administrators and examinees. ",
            "Preparing online questions needs a lot of efforts from technical team. ",
            "Questions should be standardized with student\u2019s level.\n",
            "Some of the instructional designers are sometimes not equipped with skills to develop the best examination procedure. ",
            "Sponsors need to ensure that all instructional designers and administrators are qualified to reduce detrimental. ",
            "If all these issues are attended to, advantages of computer-based testing outweigh detrimental.\n",
            "The method will be beneficial to instructors and students if well administered. ",
            "More studies need to be conducted to ascertain some of the variation in scores of computer based and pencil-based tests. ",

            "This has relieved many people from performing dangerous tasks. ",
            "Most of the manufacturing processes are automated and the computer and other innovative technologies are used to monitor the processes and their correct implementation (Card and DiNardo 750).\n",
            "Therefore, the use of computers at the manufacturing helped people get rid of the dangerous work and become more professionally useful in other spheres. ",
            "This is one of the most positive effects as the manufacturing of many products became easier and less dangerous, however, there are still professions which include much hazard and the computer revolution has brought nothing particular for them.\n",

            "The profession\n",
            "One profession that is earning higher than the equilibrium wage rate is computer technician job; the main work of the technicians is to repairs and maintains computers hardware, software, computer accessories, and servers.\n",
            "Other than the tasks started above, at high level, technicians are involved in the works of configuring new hardware, maintaining system networks, installing and updating software packages; there are different ranks and levels of the career from certificate level to doctorate level. ",

            "Source of demand\n",
            "The main source of demand for computer technicians comes from corporate and individual customers who have adopted current technologies in computers. ",
            "There is an increased use of computer for various activities; the computers, both hardware and software need to be maintained and managed; this is the role of the technicians.\n",

            "To tap the increasing market, technicians use different methods; they include formal employment, freelance computer technicians and businesses.\n",
            "When employed, their wages is relatively high compared to wage of other people in different professions. ",

            "On the other hand, it is considered as one of the courses that require high college entry marks thus it limits the number of students that engage and take the course this further reduces the supply of professionals.\n",
            "Another thing that has affected the supply of the labor is increased movement of trained profession to other nations where they go to get better chances in life; the outflow makes the United State market suffer a deficit (Sobel and Stroup 23).\n",
            "Government control and regulations\n",
            "Although the United States regulates wages and salaries in the economy, it does not set the highest limit that someone should get as his or her salary. ",

            "The continued use of computers in our everyday life is beginning to alter how we as humans behave. ",
            "For instance, \u201cmultitasking, output and efficiency\u201d (Ullman 2) concepts that ideally just work for machines are slowly defining \u201chuman thought and imagination\u201d (Ullman 2).\n",
            "Computers have a way of actively engaging an individual or seeking their attention when they are about their businesses by either popping up messages on the desktop about \u201cunused icons on your desktop\u201d (Ullman 1) or aid you in writing a document with software like \u201cClippit\u201d (Ullman 1).\n",
            "The concept of multitasking \u201cintroduced in 1960\u2019s, was an engineering strategy for making computers more efficient\u201d (Ullman 1) and it achieved this by switching \u201cits attention to some other task\u201d (Ullman 1) while waiting for the next human input when being used.\n",
            "It is only natural for humans to want to adapt this type of efficiency after \u201cyears of working in an environment where efficiency is a god and idleness in any component is intolerable\u201d (Ullman 2) by keeping themselves \u201cas busy as possible\u201d and focusing on different things at the same time (Ullman 2).\n",
            "For instance, we can \u201cdrive, eat, talk on the cell phone\u201d simultaneously in an attempt to be efficient; \u201cthe ability to multitask, to switch rapidly among many competing focuses of attention, has become a hallmark of a successful citizen of the 21 st century\u201d (Ullman 1). ",
            "With its continuous advancements, modern technology will continue having an impact especially in the areas of communication, information and lifestyle.\n",
            "Technology and Communication\n",
            "Communication has never been faster or even more instant with the day to day use of both phones and computers. ",
            "Phones transitioned from the basic feature phones people used to own for the sole purpose of calling and texting, to smart phones that have amazing capabilities and have adapted the concepts of computers. ",
            "In his article, Mobile Telephone History, Tim Farley exhaustively discussed the development of these devices.\n",
            "These devices have brought unique changes (Farley 1). ",
            "Firstly, mobile phones, whether the smart phones or otherwise, provide an avenue for communication among people of different geographic locations, making distance no obstacle. ",
            "Software like Skype, enable voice or video calls over the internet and this links friends and families in different continents whether using phones or computers. ",
            "Secondly, communication has also become instant since one is able to get immediate feedback without delays.\n",
            "Email services have facilitated efficient communication between employers and employees, students and lecturers, in comparison to letter writing which as compared to previous times would take much longer. ",
            "Thirdly, all these devices have reduced face to face/personal interaction since communication is hugely done using these avenues. ",
            "This is definitely a negative effect in as much as communication has been enhanced by modern technology.\n",
            "Technology and Information/Education\n",
            "Modern technology has in effect enhanced our accessibility to information, whether it is about general world news or completing our research projects for school work. ",
            "In terms of education: students are able to have online discussion forums, do extensive researches and currently there are even online courses which are available for those who cannot attend classes (this is a milestone since conventionally, classrooms were the only forums of learning).\n",
            "Thomas highlighted some negativity to this form of education. ",
            "He claimed that although \u201conline discussion forums can be effective in developing student\u2019s knowledge\u2026they do not allow for social construction between students\u201d (Thomas 1).\n",
            "Another commendable result of modern technology is its ability to make the globe small, i.e. ",
            "when it comes to television; people in various places can all be streaming live news coverage in a totally different location from the viewers. ",
            "This means that information is widespread and covers a larger span in the shortest time possible.\n",
            "Technology has also enabled news and other events watched on television to be streamed live using computers connected to the internet. ",
            "Other than education and information, in recent times there have been social networks like facebook, tweeter, among others which the young generation has particularly embraced as a form of disbursing information. ",
            "Much of the rapid spread of news, information and even learning material owe it to technology for providing easy instant access to such.\n",
            "Technology and lifestyle\n",
            "Our lifestyles have been transformed by advancing technology. ",
            "Life can definitely be said to have become easier in more ways than one. ",
            "First change that is undeniably notable is in the house environment.\n",
            "People own microwaves, dishwashers, washing machines, driers, vacuum cleaners etc, all in an attempt to ease the work they need to do. ",
            "Secondly, the transport industry cannot be said to have been left behind in this technology. ",
            "Buses, planes trains and trams, all characterize how we are networking the different geographic locations in order that efficient mobility is achieved.\n",
            "Lastly, the work environment is also not spared for there are different machines and devices that have been adapted to improve productivity and enhance efficiency. ",
            "Robots are also gaining popularity in such forums since they can do the extra work humans allocate them. ",
            "With all this in mind, as much as our lifestyle is improving by reducing the amount of work we do, caution need to be taken that individuals do not resort to laziness with the excuse that machines will do the work for them.\n",

            "Computers & Preschool Children: Why they are required in Early Childhood Centers Research Paper\n",
            "Today, more than ever before, technology is increasingly documented as a fundamental learning tool for advancing the social, emotional, intellectual and linguistic development of young children. ",
            "Indeed, the question being asked by educators and parents in the 21 st century is no longer about whether and to what scope information and communication technologies (ICTs) should be utilized with young children in early childhood centers, but rather how it should be employed to achieve maximum benefits (Couse & Chen, 2010).\n",
            "Educators readily acknowledge the fact that keeping up with the ongoing convergence of technology for the classroom presents unique challenges to them as they come to terms with the ever growing potential of ICTs to augment the capacity of young children to learn, solve problems, and express their thoughts. ",
            "It is against this background that this essay will seek to demonstrate why computers are a necessity in early childhood learning.\n",
            "A wide body of literature demonstrates that preschool children are not only empowered by the use of computers, but the utilization of the new media in learning environments is central to enhancing their creativity, development of ideas, collaborative play and enculturation into the knowledge society and economy (Stephen & Plowman, 2003).\n",
            "This view is reinforced by Long-Breipohl (n.d.), who postulates that computers are great motivators for learning, in part, due to the fact that they encourage interaction among young children. ",
            "Empowerment, enculturation into the knowledge society and promotion of interaction, in my view, goes a long way towards providing an enabling environment where young children can be able to benefit intellectually, especially in the development and conveyance of ideas.\n",
            "Computers can be purposively used by preschool children to record their creative work. ",
            "This affords them the opportunity to interact with the devices \u2013 may they be desktops, laptops, tablets or iPods \u2013 to better understand at an early age how they operate for future use.\n",
            "Long-Breipohl (n.d.) is of the opinion that \u201c\u2026the earlier a child is introduced to the use of computers, the better will he be prepared for coping with the demands of workplaces later in life and the greater is the likelihood of a successful future\u201d (p. ",
            "1). ",
            "In this perspective, the use of computers for learning in preschool age is positively correlated to a brighter future thereafter.\n",
            "Computers, according to Breipohl (n.d.), can be used to improve a child\u2019s academic achievement. ",
            "Indeed, computers and other related technologies are playing a critical role in accessing information, and it is a well documented fact that any form of learning is highly dependent on information.\n",
            "In consequence, it can be argued that any form of media that will afford a child the access of relevant educational content will inarguably go a long way to improve his academic achievement. ",
            "Computers, when used in collaboration with the internet, link the child to a whole new world of learning possibilities. ",
            "It is against this backdrop that stakeholders in the education sector have discovered the intrinsic value of computers to the learning process.\n",
            "Growth and development is rapid in early childhood \u2013 a phase of individual development witnessed from birth all the way to the age of 8 years. ",
            "Accordingly, researchers and educators have highlighted the significance \u201c\u2026of the children\u2019s active use of technology in making decisions, technology resources in writing and drawing, and logical thinking programs to solve problems and illustrate ideas\u201d (Couse & Chen, 2010, p. ",
            "76).\n",
            "These are fundamental concepts that must be conveyed to the child at an early age, and computers and other forms of technologies offer the needed platform for the needed impartment to take place. ",
            "It should be remembered that any form of technology that enhances children\u2019s thinking capacities also affords them prospects for active control and problem solving while granting educators a much needed window into the children\u2019s social and intellectual development (Stephen & Plowman, 2003).\n",
            "Inquiry-based learning forms a critical component of the education process, and the internet is being used by many educators around the world to assist young children to develop their inquiry techniques by showing them how to find content that builds on their learning interests (Hertzog & Klein, 2005). ",
            "According to Wang et al (2010), \u201c\u2026children naturally explore and learn about their environments through inquiry, and computer technologies offer an accessible vehicle for extending the domain and range of this inquiry\u201d (p. ",
            "381).\n",
            "In addition to this observation, online inquiry-based learning has the potential to broaden children\u2019s intellectual capacities in ways that traditional techniques of learning may not be able to match due to the nature and scope of information found on the internet, and also due to accessibility of diverse range of information. ",
            "This observation is advantageous to the very objective of learning for knowledge accumulation.\n",
            "Away from issues of inquiry-based learning, Hertzog & Klein (2005) asserts that \u201c\u2026computers can serve as catalysts for social interaction and emotional growth\u201d (p.25).\n",
            "Social and emotional development forms a critical area for young children by virtue of the fact that they serve as basis for future development and growth, including the capacity to socialize with others, the development of self-esteem and identity, and, by extension, development of their cognitive abilities. ",
            "Indeed, Hertzog & Klein (2005) opines that the use of computers by preschoolers facilitate both social and intellectual relations \u2013 each to the advantage of the other.\n",
            "In addition, the authors suggests that that good software facilitates children in early childhood centers to talk more about their collaborative and creative work, not mentioning the fact that they are afforded the framework to engage in more sophisticated cognitive types of play than traditional techniques can allow. ",
            "Long-Breipohl (n.d.) is of the opinion that the educational software that is presently available can, to a large extent, be depended upon to assist young children in the learning process.\n",
            "Another advantage of using computers in early childhood centers arises from the fact that technology, when employed effectively, generates an active interaction between the child and the content. ",
            "Indeed, computers should be introduced at an early age because the complexity of the mentioned interactions increases with continuous usage and the level of the child\u2019s talent.\n",
            "In line with the above observation, researchers and educators have noted that children who employ technology from an early age for creative and educational purposes engage in much more meaningful learning than those who basically utilizes instruction-based approach (Hertzog & Klein, 2005).\n",
            "What\u2019s more, computers have been found to facilitate the expression and progression of originality in the learning process. ",
            "Such an attribute, in my view, must be used to benefit young children in the development of their creative and innovative capacities.\n",
            "Lastly, computers should be used in early childhood centers by virtue of the fact that they have the capacity to incorporate instructional techniques in early childhood inquiry education to, among other things, \u201c\u2026enrich and provide structure for problem contexts, facilitate resource utilization, and support cognitive and meta-cognitive processes\u201d (Wang et al., 2010, p.381).\n",
            "Inquiry, according to the authors, has long being advanced as the best basis for children learning, especially in critical subjects such as science, mathematics and the progression of language and literacy.\n",
            "Children impulsively inquire, posing questions and investigating, to better understand the world. ",
            "In this respect, computers, by their very own interactive nature, should be used to nurture and cultivate this attribute because it is beneficial to an individual\u2019s life-long development (Wang et al., 2010).\n",
            "To conclude, this essay has laid bare all the advantages that computers bring to the social, emotional, educational and cognitive life of preschoolers. ",
            "In this day and age, computers must never be viewed as peripherals in educational and developmental needs of young children; rather, they must be used as essential tools that serve to enhance the learning experience of these preschoolers.\n",
            "Of course computers have their own disadvantages, especially in exposing the minors to undesirable content (Stephen & Plowman, 2003). ",
            "But when used effectively, the benefits computers offer to preschool children far outweigh their social costs.\n",

            "The course has a principal thesis that caters for origin and description of argumentation. ",
            "Students need to learn the purpose and style of writing an argumentative essay. ",
            "With the help of amplification of opinions, a good professional argument demonstrates effectiveness and purpose.\n",
            "The school argumentative essay must follow key features of a good writing style. ",
            "These are emphasis from the collage or school tutoring systems. ",
            "In comparison to professional argumentation in the work force, Chryssafidou (n.d, 2), indicates that it is challenging and often difficult to write an argumentative essay especially within an applicable area such as the workplace.\n",
            "One has to see ideas in a systematic format in support of one position of the argument and disproval of the other. ",
            "Essential skills taught in school covers components, schemes or patterns that are essential for easy and academically related essays. ",
            "Professional style of writing proposes the dialectic form of essay, which utilizes computer supportive setting to support the position of the argument.\n",
            "This assists in captivating an argument as a procedure to solve differences of opinions by supporting opinions with arguments, while anticipating counterarguments, instead of critical analysis of specific characteristics of an argument Chryssafidou (n.d, 2). ",
            "One has to find ways of refuting the counter-arguments to strengthen personal opinion.\n",
            "According to Chryssafidou (n.d, 4), computer systems support opinions through provision of illustrative arguments. ",
            "They also assist in engaging professional in formulation of illustrations and encourage dialogue through exchange of comments. ",
            "This procedure assists in entangling difficult situations.\n",
            "The formal education on essay writing lacks the opportunity to build up experiences as a critical aspect of solving challenges. ",
            "Students often forget to substantiate their side of the argument at the beginning of the essay. ",
            "They either lack enough understanding or ignore requirements to have a stand of opinion, to build up a logical debate within the essay.\n",
            "The evident difference between professional and academic argumentative essay is that students will engage in an argument to refute a certain point-of-view and reject the opinion without proper justification. ",
            "In line with Chryssafidou\u2019s article (n.d, 5); proper formalism of an argumentation is imminent in a computer system.\n",
            "The system is a procedure that consists of various elements and connectors to construct the argument. ",
            "The elements are \u201cclaims, data, warrant, backing, issues, position and arguments\u201d (Chryssafidou, n.d, 5). ",
            "Various suggestive efforts of the software tool relate to formulation of arguments and assists in identification of a relationship between claims and supportive evidence.\n",
            "The article assists students on matters concern with formulation of professional arguments. ",
            "It helps one in choosing an opinion when initiating an argument, formulating clear disagreements through clarified structures, enhancing procedures for planning and writing the essay. ",
            "The article also offers the option of writing an essay in a virtual context through online tutorials and provides guidance over formulation of collaborative appraisals as opposed to cumulative assessment of a situation.\n",
            "By analysis of this text, I have learnt that one should not assume familiarity of argumentation skills and schemes when that knowledge lacks developed experience and substantive support. ",
            "Strong arguments have well-built support such as the dialectic essays that are computer aided.\n",
            "The academic essay may have strong support from various resources but lack the required characteristics to synthesis them into a coherent scene. ",
            "There is a difference between developing an opinion followed by a reason for the choice, and developing an argument together with high-levelled standards in support of the position.\n",
            "This article raises various concerns over significance of argumentative analysis. ",
            "The author presents a different perspective to the academic guidance of written argumentative essay, which is the use of computer-aided models. ",
            "The main question is whether the arguer has the ability to determine the critical aspects of an argument and state the presumptions or principals of an argument. ",
            "These features often face implicit omission in school writing and guidance.\n",
            "Which aspects of an argument lead to deeper and consultative disagreements that can provide better understanding of the argument? ",
            "According to Chryssafidou\u2019s article (n.d, 9), it is possible to present different parts of a large argumentative transcript and merge the results to a unified structure. ",
            "Is it possible to present basic elements of a contrasting argument? ",
            "Is it feasible to have an illustration of interdependence between common or otherwise conflicting conclusions?\n",
            "Other concerns raised by the article points out on existence of errors connected to assumptions that arguments consist of single datum. ",
            "While the structural representation of arguments in a computer system brings out details clearly, the legitimacy of an opinion depends on the structure of argument.\n",
            "The computer-aided system however lacks policies and governing procedures. ",
            "Does lack of policies compromise viability? ",
            "The extra support of structuring problems and revealing possible solutions or options of designing and recording decisions is an excellent way of availing proposals to a problem for future reference.\n",
            "The main weaknesses connected to the computer-aided designs for projecting a problem lies on details pertaining components of the argument, since there is compromise on overall goals and argumentative text. ",
            "Other limitations concern reconstruction procedures. ",

            "Application of computer systems in hospitals will help in minimizing extensive mobility within the hospitals as hospital workers move around to access physically dispersed people, knowledge and shared resources.\n",
            "Hospitals computer systems should have a central database that should be used for storing all patients\u2019 records. ",
            "The presence of a central database will help different hospital personnel to easily access patients\u2019 medical records for medication purposes.\n",
            "For example, when a patient is requested to go for a lab test, the lab technician should send the patients results to a central database where the physician can easily access it and recommend appropriate medication. ",
            "Similarly, a central database is essential to nurses as they can use it to confirm doctors\u2019 prescriptions. ",
            "Moreover, a central database will be of great importance in instances where the nurses realize that there are some inconsistencies in a patient\u2019 record.\n",
            "The nurses can request the concerned physician to retrieve the patient\u2019s record and make necessary changes without forcing the nurse to go to the filing cabinet to retrieve the patient\u2019s hand copy and take it to the physician for correction. ",
            "Nursing assistants will easily record patients\u2019 vitals and synchronous the information with the patients\u2019 record in the central database.\n",
            "The central database will be important to the physician as well as pharmacy department as it will be used to keep a record of those medicines that the hospital has stocked. ",
            "This will be important to the physician during the prescription process as it will enable him/her to be aware of all the substitutes\u2019 drugs that are available in the hospital in order to know which drugs to subscribe to the patient.\n",
            "Providing a central database will help in managing hospital processes more effectively. ",
            "For example incomplete orders from the physicians will easily be corrected. ",
            "Equally, the tracking of lab and radiology orders will be easy to manage since the concerned technicians will send the results directly to the central database where physician can easily access them (Preece, 2002).\n",
            "It has been observed that poor communication methods that are employed in hospitals are the main causes for the high interruptions present in hospitals that are blamed for the high instances of inefficiency in work practices. ",
            "Studies have shown that there is a high association between interruption level and medical errors. ",
            "Adopting computer based communication facilities will greatly boost the communication efficiency in hospitals.\n",
            "For example, the use of emails will help to eliminate those communications that are synchronous in nature such as face-to-face as well as telephone conversations that are associated with high level of interruptions. ",
            "Therefore, the uses of email as well as instant messaging for urgent cases are more effective in hospital setting. ",
            "Relevant parties should be advised to check their emails at specified time intervals and respond accordingly (Parker & Coiera, 2000).\n",
            "Hospital wards are mainly distributed work environment as a result of hospitals workers being spatially separated because of their constant mobility as well as the propensity of hospital work being distributed in time. ",
            "Therefore, the presence of central database as well as use of emails for communications purposes will facilitate passing of important information from one shift to the next to ensure continuity of patients information.\n",
            "To avoid interruptions, mobile communications should be used only for emergencies. ",
            "Finally, the hospital computer system should be secured accordingly in order to secure patients\u2019 information from unauthorized access that can render to maliciously damage or altering of the patients\u2019 records (Waegemann & Tessier, 2002).\n",
